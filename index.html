                                <h5>Chapter 1</h5>
                                <p> Deep in the night, Batman overlooks the streets of Gotham from a rooftop, noting how quiet the city has become, calling it the Gotham he has always dreamed of. But the Dark Knight is quick to realize this dream has been perverted into a nightmare as he watches foot soldiers march in the streets below, carrying the insignia of the world's new iron-fisted ruler...the crest of the House of El, the symbol of the Man of Steel, Superman.

                                The comic jumps five years back, switching to Metropolis with Clark Kent suddenly awakening in bed as his super-hearing catches something and he looks at his sleeping wife, Lois Lane, and smiles as she awakens as well- Clark's hearing have picked up a second heartbeat within her. Clark is quick to begin making plans for their unborn child's future and well-being, ignoring Lois's calls to him, forcing her to throw a book at his head to get his attention. Though happy he's preparing for their child's future, Lois tells Clark to just enjoy the moment as they lean in for a kiss, only for Lois to get a sudden text message on a tip-off for a story of a corrupt senator taking bribes the Daily Planet is covering.

                                Lois decides to head out, shrugging off Clark's worries as she gets dressed and jokingly teases that he's only concerned about the baby. Clark suddenly gazes out into the city and Lois asks if there is trouble. Unsure, Clark replies maybe and Lois says they're both needed tonight. The two share a kiss and Lois tells him, "Go save the world."

                                The scene cuts to Batman fighting a group of thugs, with Superman watching and asking him why he's in Metropolis. Batman explains that something was stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs and he's on his way to investigate. Superman flies towards a rooftop, telling him to meet up with him when he's done with the thugs. Atop the roof, Superman prepares to tell Batman the news but the Dark Knight has already deduced it, surprising the Man of Steel.

                                Meanwhile, Lois meets up with Jimmy at the docks, with the younger man complaining of the cold and how the senator is late. Lois tells him to be patient when they spot someone approaching. Jimmy realizes it's not the senator as a gun barrel is thrust against the lens of his camera.

                                Back with the World's Finest, Superman asks Batman to be the godfather, successfully catching the stoic detective off-guard. Bruce smiles as he hears Clark speak of how he could hear his child's heartbeat while the two men gaze down on the illuminated city below.

                                Back at the docks, Jimmy is executed with a single gunshot before a horrified Lois...as she is greeted by the Joker and Harley Quinn.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Chapter 2</h5>
                                <p>The next morning, Superman is horrified to discover Jimmy's body at the docks...next to a bloody Joker card.

                                Meanwhile, Batman is at S.T.A.R. Labs, looking over the damaged labs and questioning a scientist if anything else was stolen. The scientist explains only a small amount of equipment was taken and then points out why they didn't want to contact Superman. Batman points out they were experimenting with kryptonite.

                                The scientist tries to defend their actions, saying it was for beneficial reasons, not to hurt Superman, and that they are not monsters. As Batman looks down on the corpses of several lab workers, their faces twisted into horrible grins, Superman suddenly bursts in, panicked and telling Batman he can't find Lois. Batman tries to calmly remind him they're in public but when the Man of Steel holds up the Joker's bloody playing card, and pleads with his friend to help him.

                                The Dark Knight instantly understands and issues a priority call to all available Justice League members to head for Metropolis and help in the search for the Joker and to find Lois. While Green Arrow is incredulous, Cyborg is a little more helpful and Wonder Woman immediately heads for the docks where she was last seen. Batman next contacts the Flash, who is instantly in Metropolis and searches the entire city at super-speed at Batman's request.

                                A moment later, Barry comes back and takes Batman to see what he has found- the body of the Scarecrow in S.T.A.R. Labs, the deceased super-villain's face also twisted into a horrible grin, his murderer all too obvious.

                                Wonder Woman suddenly reports on a lead she found after using her Lasso of Truth on a witness who reveals the Joker has hijacked a submarine. A split-second later, Superman scans the waters around Metropolis and finds the sub, scuttling it onto land with his bare hands and tearing a hole in the hull to get inside. He is horrified to see the Joker and Harley seemingly operating on Lois, but before he can free her, the Joker gasses him, confusing the Man of Steel as he suddenly becomes dizzy...and then horrified to see the monster Doomsday standing before him.</p>
                                <h5>Chapter 3</h5>
                                <p>Confronted by the monster that killed him, Superman, fearing for his wife and unborn child's life, tackles the beast out of the sub and into the sky, while the Joker and Harley Quinn look on. The Joker decides to leave and has to convince a reluctant Harley to leave the stolen sub (Which she named Gunter) before the rest of the Justice League show up. They don't get very far before Green Lantern and Wonder Woman appear, with Lantern subduing them with a giant hand construct.

                                The Flash arrives with Batman in tow moments later, and while the Joker is delighted to poke fun at his nemesis for being carried by the Flash, the Dark Knight quickly investigates the sub, but not before placing a gas mask over his face when he notices Scarecrow's fear toxin laced within. Unable to locate Lois, he demands her location from the Clown Prince of Crime and stops Wonder Woman from using her Lasso on him, understanding that the Joker's warped mind would spill anything but the truth. The Joker refuses to give a straight answer, telling Batman he already knows what's going on, but simply refuses to accept it.

                                Still demanding answers, Batman learns that the Joker operated on Lois, turning her into a 'trigger'. Batman orders Flash to search the sub for its missile but the Joker tells him no to bother and that when Lois's heart stops, Metropolis stops with it. Confused, Batman suddenly puts it all together, realizing that the kryptonite stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs was laced into Scarecrow's fear toxin to infect Superman. Desperately attempting to contact the Man of Steel, who has flown 'Doomsday' all the way into the outer atmosphere when Superman suddenly clutches his head in a daze.

                                The Joker then mockingly asks Batman if he knew Lois was pregnant, prompting an enraged Dark Knight to punch him across the jaw. Batman then screams to Superman, "IT'S LOIS!" just as Clark sees his wife's body floating before him.

                                Horrified, Clark sheds a tear as he hears both heartbeats stop, while the Joker grins and says, "Boom." Just then, the nuclear bomb from the sub goes off in the heart of Metropolis, destroying the city in a single blast before the horrified eyes of the Justice League.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 4-5</h3>
                               <h5>Chapter 4</h5>
                               <p>As Superman cradles his wife's body and returns to the heart of his devastated city, on his knees with grief, Batman interrogates the Joker in a holding room in Gotham City's prison, demanding to know why he went so far as to trick Superman into killing his wife, unborn child and destroy his city. The Joker explains he was tired of losing to him and wanted to "Try it on easy" and declares that it was easy.

                                Back in the ruins of Metropolis, the Flash and Green Lantern have managed to remove some survivors from the city and the outlining area and Green Lantern questions Superman's location, with Flash revealing he is still in the city, his communicator no longer functioning because of the radiation. Flash explains no one else could survive that much radiation...

                                Within the ruins of his city, Wonder Woman approaches the grieving Superman, consoling him as he blames himself for Lois's death, reminding him the Joker is the one who is truly responsible. Considering her words, Clark asks Diana to hold Lois's body before flying off. He is intercepted by Green Lantern, who inadvertently reveals the Joker's location. Lantern, knowing how much pain Superman is in, tries to stop him using a shield construct but Superman easily smashes it to nothing and even manages to steal the ring off of Hal's finger, but catches him as he falls and destroys his communicator so he can't warn Batman. Despite Jordan's pleas for him not to do something he will regret, Superman flies off, declaring he already has.

                                Back at the Gotham Prison, the Joker reaches out to Batman, saying because someone took something away from him once, he became what he is today, and asks the Dark Knight what Superman will become after this, saying he was already a god who deluded himself into thinking he was a man. Batman is convinced that the Joker has failed to corrupt Superman, but the Clown Prince of Crime disagrees, saying it will be "A whole lot funnier than that."

                                Just then, Superman breaks through the wall, shoving Batman aside to get to the Joker. Without a word, Superman kills the Joker by shoving his arm through his chest, the Clown Prince of Crime dying with one last exhaled laugh and smile, while Batman looks on in horror.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 5</h5>
                                <p>A mourning Harley Quinn murders the officers escorting her to Arkham after hearing about the Joker's murder and uses the officers car to head to one of her and the Joker's hideout, utterly despondent as she does, no longer caring now that the Joker is dead. Once at the hideout, she dons her costume just as Green Arrow arrives. She throws a grenade at him just as he fires an arrow, stunning him.

                                Harley advances and attacks Arrow with a large mallet, which turns out to be a squeak toy. Discarding the hammer, she pulls out a gun instead but Arrow manages to fire a bolt into the gun barrel, causing it to discharge harmlessly, amusing Harley greatly as she asks him to do it again. Arrow instead fires a net-arrow and successfully ensnares her.

                                After he's dragged her into his Arrowcar, Harley asks if he's taking her to Superman but Arrow denies this, explaining he's trying to save Superman from what he might do. Harley further annoys Arrow by asking more questions about his trick arrows and where he's taking her, before Arrow finally tricks her into knocking herself out with a gas-arrow.

                                When she wakes back up, Green Arrow has her hand-cuffed in his Arrow Cave, and while trying to explain she will be safe there, Harley just mocks the cave's name and suggests he call it 'the Quiver' instead. Arrow admits that's a better name. He tells her he has to leave and warns her not to try and use a fake hand to escape.

                                Harley sadly admits the Joker used the fake-hand gag while she used a fake mustache, saying no one has to justify a fake mustache. Harley then admits that while she knew the Joker was bad for her, she still hurts from losing him. Arrow is surprised that he understand what she means.

                                Harley then asks him to give her a little "maniacal laughter" which Arrow reluctantly gives into after seeing her put on her fake mustache, much to Harley's delight.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 6-7</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 6</h5>
                                <p>Superman sits within his Fortress of Solitude, disheveled and still grieving for the loss of his family and city, all the while dozens of monitors surround him, with news programs all covering the same story: The destruction of Metropolis and the Man of Steel's murder of the Joker. Superman continues to listen when he hears a story over Biayla's bombing and communication blackout. Rising up, Superman declares, "No more" and flies out of his Fortress, his grief now replaced by determination.

                                In the Biayla city of Gared, Superman saves a boy from a munitions shell and destroys three more with his heat vision, saving dozens of grateful citizens. Superman apologizes to them for not being there before and flies off again, this time to Biayla's capital. Easily making his way inside and ignoring attacks from the president's men, Superman snatches Biayla's president and flies back to Gared, showing him the bodies of his people and declaring his presidency over for failing to protect them.

                                Wonder Woman suddenly appears behind Clark, landing next to him and pointing out the cameras, though the Man of Steel doesn't care and tells Diana he plans to address the world. Wonder Woman disagrees, saying the world will hear him but not there and after he's cleaned himself up. Superman agrees and leaves after Diana tells him she will call a press conference...and whispers to herself that he will finally say what she has waited for him to say since they first met.

                                Later, Superman arrives before the United Nations with the Biayla president, the press and Wonder Woman waiting. The Man of Steel apologies for his failings and reveals his secret identity as Clark Kent to the world. He then makes it clear that he will never let an event like Metropolis happen again and declares he will not allow anymore innocent blood to be shed or for world leader's to attack their own people, and that he does not care how politically powerful they are, he will stop them.

                                Declaring an immediate cease-fire for the entire world, Superman makes it clear they are to stop...or he will stop them himself. </p>

                                <h5>Chapter 7</h5>

                                <p>The U.S. Government is attempting to use an aerial drone to bomb a village a terrorist leader is hiding out in when Superman destroys the drone, unwilling to let innocent lives be harmed by the bomb. The general overseeing the bombing is angered by Superman's interference and pressures the U.S. President to allowing him to come up with a plan to force Superman to stop interfering.

                                The general explains they have a single card to play against Superman, and while the President is worried about this being traced back to them if they fail, the general assures him the plan won't fail and that nothing can be traced back to them. The President is still in disbelief over a plan to take out Superman. The general then explains they're not going after Superman...

                                A team of armed men break into the Kent's farmhouse and attempt to kidnap Clark Kent's parents, Jonathan and Martha, in their sleep. When the leader of the team grabs Martha, Jonathan attacks him but is subdued shortly. The mercenaries then set the house on fire, and the leader, revealed to be Mirror Master, teleports the mercenaries and the Kents into a mirror shard, moments before Superman arrives.

                                He calls for his parents but is greeted by Mirror Master from a mirror shard, with the rogue assuring him they're safe for now. Superman demands his parents return but Mirror Master refuses, and further angers the Man of Steel by mentioning his assault on his father. Mirror Master then tells Superman to stop interfering in the affairs of the world's governments and to go back fighting supervillains. If he does this his parents will live, but warns Superman if he forgets they will severely harmed...

                                <h3>Chapter 8-9</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 8</h5>
                                <p>On the Justice League's Watchtower, Wonder Woman has rallied together several superheroes to inform them of the Kent's kidnapping. She gives a speech on the tragedy of Metropolis, Superman's current course of actions and how whoever kidnapped them wants the heroes to know their place, but Diana refuses to submit to their demands and asks for help in finding Superman's parents, stating she believes in his current course of actions.

                                Cyborg is the first to agree to help and soon all of the heroes decide to help. When Wonder Woman tells Flash Mirror Master was the one who kidnapped them. Flash says that if they find the other Rogues, they will find Mirror Master. Wonder Woman then orders Cyborg to set the teleporter for Central City. While Hawkgirl, Cyborg and Shazam battle and interrogate Weather Wizard, Captain Boomerang and Gorilla Grodd, Flash faces Captain Cold and learns that Mirror Master is at a villain exclusive bar in Keystone City called World's End.

                                Wonder Woman and the Flash head there, and Wonder Woman dissuades her enemy Cheetah from a fight after threatening her with the rest of the League's presence. Flash attempts to grab Mirror Master, but he is inside a long wall mirror and mocks the Flash for being slow. But McCulloch is suddenly attacked by Raven, who is inside his mirror dimension with him, and forces him out halfway. After wrapping his neck with her lasso and threatening to smash the mirror while he's halfway in it, Mirror Master quickly reveals the Kents location: Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Wonder Woman then strips Mirror Master of his weapons.

                                Flash meets with Superman at Salar, the world's largest natural mirror, and gives him Mirror Master's weapons to let him into the mirror dimension to rescue his parents.

                                At the White House, the President is informed of the plan's failure and he orders a new plan be formed against an even angrier Superman. The President steps into the Oval Office and is confronted by Batman, who chides the President for going after Superman's parents. The President is shocked Batman figured it out, though the Dark Knight coldly informs him he just told him.

                                The President asks if Batman will tell the League of his involvement and Batman says he won't but warns him if they ever find out on their own. The President is convinced they wouldn't touch him but Batman says no one would find his body on Saturn. Batman explains that the President's plan failed but succeeded in uniting the other heroes behind Superman.

                                The President notes Batman's use of terms and realizes Batman knows the path Superman is heading down. Batman says Superman is trying to bring about peace but the President asks how Superman will keep that peace. The President admits power corrupts as Batman leaves.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 9</h5>
                                <p>An unknown figure observes Wonder Woman as she battles military forces, complimenting her skill, power and ferocity as she tears fighter jets apart. Wonder Woman soon contacts Superman to inform him of her success in forcing the forces to retreat back to their country of Qurac when she is attacked by tanks. Diana destroys one of them with a single headbutt, with the unknown figure stating that despite her desire for peace, she revels in war...and reveals Ares, God of War, himself before Diana.

                                Amused by her tactics against the tank, Ares explains in response to Wonder Woman's demands for an answer to his presence that he only wishes to watch her work. He goes to explain that while he has seen many wars, a war between superhumans and regular human armies is something special. Diana explains she is not at war with Qurac, only forcing their forces to stop attacking their defenseless neighboring country so that the issue can be resolved peacefully.

                                Ares asks her if she believes in Superman's cause, and Diana confirms this as she scares off more soldiers who attempt to attack. Ares calls her too merciful before asking Diana if she will "Take her place? Will you lie in his bed?" confronting her unspoken feelings for Superman. Wonder Woman admits that Lois was an incredible woman, and when Ares presses for an answer, Diana says she will let him grieve.

                                Wonder Woman calls Superman the greatest man she has ever known and then questions Ares over his fear of her and Superman's union. She asks Ares what he will become if Superman's endeavors succeed and mockingly suggests he become a god of something less violent. Enraged, Ares attacks Diana, proclaiming that Zeus himself would not save her so long as they are on a battlefield where Ares is strongest.

                                Before he can harm Wonder Woman, Superman appears and takes Ares down with a single blow, allowing Diana to cut off his hand. When Ares threatens her further, she impales him with her sword and leaves him to bleed. Superman, while disturbed by this, is assured by Wonder Woman that Ares will not die and the two head off to begin peace negotiations.

                                As they leave, Ares admits to himself he fears that Diana will strip away Superman's restraint, and nothing in the world would be able to stand against them if such an even occurred, and in a world without war, Ares is unsure what he would become...</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 10-12</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 10</h5>
                                <p>Nightwing and Robin are sparring in the Batcave, with Nightwing having bested Robin and chiding him trying to go for a killing blow and failing to mind his legs. Nightwing briefly turns his back on Damian while telling him some criminals deserve second chances and they can't have them if Damian keeps going for lethal blows, allowing the younger man to throw one of his kali sticks at Nightwing's head- only for Superman to suddenly appear and catch it. Robin is shocked by the Man of Steel's sudden appearance while Nightwing is unfazed by Damian's sneak attack.

                                Superman asks if Batman is in and Nightwing tells him he's on his computer while Damian warns him he's being 'broodier' than usual. Superman starts to head further down into the cave when Damian suddenly thanks him for his execution of the Joker. Superman then asks Nightwing to take Robin and give him and Batman some privacy. Though confused, Dick agrees.

                                Superman confronts Batman at the Batcomputer, demanding to know why he wasn't there to help him find his parents. Batman only tells him he needs to stop what he is doing. Shocked, Superman proclaims he is saving lives and bringing dictators to justice, but Batman tells him he is scaring people. Superman suddenly lashes out, ripping off the Dark Knight's cowl with a scream of "GOOD!"

                                Superman rants about how they should be scared, too scared to hurt each other, and how he learned that from Batman. Bruce tries to say something but Superman goes on, saying he would be doing exactly what he is doing now if he had his abilities. Bruce reminds Clark that he killed a man, but Clark is quick to remind Bruce of all the times he let the Joker live, condemning more innocent lives. He asks him if he ever felt guilty or responsible.

                                Bruce admits he did, every time.

                                He tries to remind Clark that they don't get to decide who lives and who dies, but Superman justifies that one death saved millions of lives. Batman tells him that's how justification works, but soon the line of right and wrong will blur as he continues to justify his actions.

                                The scene shifts to a whaling operation off the coast of Japan, where an enraged Aquaman is consoling an injured whale. Infuriated, he tips the ship over to save the whales and a crewmen sends a distress call. Cyborg intercepts it and calls for all fliers to head there and help. Green Lantern, Shazam, Hawkgirl and Wonder Woman answer the call and soon learn it is not an attack from a country ignoring Superman's ceasefire.

                                Aquaman rises up from the seas with an Atlantean fleet and attacks the ship, denting the hull with a single punch and threatening a crewmen who fell overboard, begging for his life. Wonder Woman tries to appease to Arthur but he refuses to heed Superman's ceasefire, claiming it is his duty to protect the seas and all that inhabit them. Wonder Woman calmly tries to talk the situation out with Aquaman, but as she begins to approach him, she is shot in the face by one of his soldiers.

                                Aquaman angrily reprimands the soldier, but as he goes to check on Diana, she backhands him aside, infuriated and declaring she is sick of words, with her and the rest of the League advancing on Arthur's forces. </p>

                                <h5>Chapter 11</h5>
                                <p>Bleeding and unconscious, Aquaman is awakened by the whales he saved and promptly grabs Wonder Woman just as she is giving orders to the rest of the League as they face Aquaman's Atlantean fleet, dragging her under water to battle her.

                                Back at the Batcave, Superman accuses Batman of being angry at him for killing the Joker, thus taking away from him his arch-nemesis and that he is in the cave mourning the Joker, not Metropolis. Batman denies this, but Superman then asks why he didn't stop him sooner. His eyes burning red, he demands to know why Batman let the Joker do this to him.

                                Back at the Pacific Ocean, Wonder Woman grapples with Aquaman under water before Shazam intervenes and pulls Aquaman into the air. Holding him by his collar, he demands Aquaman to call off his forces and retreat, saying he is outmatched. Aquaman disagrees while behind the two, a sudden massive tidal wave rises in the distance.

                                In the Batcave, Superman tells Batman that he can't understand what the Joker took from him, the new life he and Lois were about to make with their child, and more so, Superman feels even more alone now as the true Last Son of Krypton. Superman then accuses Bruce of not consoling Dick and Damian for the friends they lost in Metropolis and then asks him what his excuse for not being a father is. Enraged, Batman punches Superman across the jaw, though fails to even faze the Man of Steel.

                                Shazam is unnerved when he sees Aquaman's army retreating, while Green Lantern and Hawkgirl see the tsunami but Hakwgirl notices there is something beyond it. When Shazam asks Aquaman what it is, Aquaman reminds him that he already knows what it is thanks to the Wisdom of Solomon. Shocked and in disbelief, Billy refuses to believe it at first until Aquaman reminds him of the company they keep and of Billy's own origins.

                                Back in the cave, Superman demands to see Batman's hand and uses his x-ray vision to see a hairline fracture on one of his fingers, advising him not to punch anything for a few weeks so it can heal. An alarm suddenly goes off, and Batman and Superman learn of the situation in the Pacific Ocean between Aquaman and the League. Superman starts to leave but Batman stops him.

                                Removing his cowl, Bruce tries to remind Clark that he's a better man than he is and that he can't use his abilities to put himself above everyone else. Superman asks Bruce to come with him, but the Dark Knight sadly refuses. Without another word, Superman turns his back to Batman and begins to leave the cave.

                                On his way he bumps into Alfred, who offers "Master Kent" some tea. Superman kindly refuses and reminds Alfred he does not have to call him master. Alfred dryly replies, "Good. Let's remember that."

                                Back at the Pacific Ocean, Wonder Woman has Green Lantern protect the ships from the tidal wave while Shazam lets Aquaman go. Hawkgirl spots what she thinks is mountains rising from the seas but Shazam corrects her as massive tentacles rise from the waters. Wonder Woman realizes they're now facing the kraken as the beast easily swats them all aside.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 12</h5>
                                <p>As the Justice League fight a losing battle against the kraken, Batman accesses both the Justice League communications and the Atlanteans, warning Aquaman of Superman's imminent approach and tells him to stop his attack on the League. Superman arrives seconds later, flying through one of the kraken's tentacles to get to Arthur, grabbing him by his neck and demanding he call the beast off. Aquaman reluctantly does and the League rises out of the ocean with survivors.

                                Superman reminds Aquaman of his world-wide ceasefire but Aquaman reminds him that his voice does not reach the ocean's depths. Aquaman starts to speak of Superman ruling the surface world but the Man of Steel proclaims he doesn't want to rule, only protect. Aquaman knows of Metropolis's destruction but refuses to let Superman rule Atlantis. Despite Batman pleading with Aquaman not to provoke him, Arthur goes on about how Superman's rule is coming whether he knows it or not, but the seas will belong to him alone.

                                Just then, Wonder Woman rushes over to tell Superman that several Atlantean fleets are rising around several major ports around the world. When Superman demands answers from Aquaman, Arthur reminds Superman that the surface world lives around the seas and that he is not a world leader who can be bullied into submission. Declaring this a show of strength, Aquaman orders the League to leave.

                                Batman calls Arthur an idiot over their communicator, saying Superman will not respond to ultimatums. Superman suddenly flies off, much to Wonder Woman's confusion, thinking he is backing down. Superman says he is not, and orders her, Shazam and Green Lantern with him. When they ask where they're going, Superman responds that since Aquaman showed his strength, they will show theirs.

                                Combining their strength with Green Lantern's constructs, Superman, Wonder Woman and Shazam lift Atlantis from its resting place deep in the Mediterranean and place it in the Sahara Desert.

                                Batman contacts Superman as the Man of Steel observes the captured city but Superman refuses to listen to him, having been fully of aware of his contact with Arthur and has Cyborg revoke Batman's communicator access, officially kicking him out of the Justice League despite Batman's protests. After this Wonder Woman appears, saying Aquaman is ready to talk but Superman refuses to say anything else and has Diana go in his place as his diplomat.

                                Wonder Woman and Aquaman speak on the shore of Algeria, with Aquaman agreeing to pull his forces back. Aquaman expresses shock over Superman's actions, thinking he was not capable of it. He urges Diana to steer him from this course of action but she refuses, believing it is what's best for the world. Aquaman tells her they are frightening many people and asks her to pass along a message to Superman, saying he should seek his counsel when ready. He also asks Diana to tell Clark he is sorry about Lois.

                                Later, Wonder Woman returns to Superman to inform him of Aquaman's retreat. Superman is pleased, happy to inform Green Lantern and Shazam they can return the city where it belongs, and admits their removal of Atlantis didn't sit well with them. Wonder Woman assures him he did the right thing, though Superman is not as sure.

                                Superman then asks Diana if Arthur said anything else. After hesitating for a split-second, Wonder Woman says he did not.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 13-14</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 13</h5>
                                <p>The Flash is seen running along the world's longest strip of land, the Nullarbor, in Australia. Calling it a speedster's nirvana, the Flash's internal monologue reveals he comes here often to run and think. But today he is only there to run.

                                Two hours earlier, the Flash accompanied Wonder Woman and Superman to a protest in Melbourne, Australia where they were trying to get the crowds to disperse peacefully when they were approached by a young man in a jacket. Saying they have the right to protest in their own country, the young man sheds his jacket to reveal a powered suit and demands that the League leave. The nameless young man blasts Superman and Wonder Woman, who easily dodge the attacks as they fly towards him.

                                As the Flash watches, he realizes how hopelessly outmatched the boy is and does nothing as Superman and Wonder Woman easily ground him, shattering his spine in the process. As the crowd looks at the beaten young man, Wonder Woman orders them to leave and they finally comply. Flash suddenly races off, telling Wonder Woman he is going to get an ambulance.

                                As he rushes off, Batman contacts Flash, surprising him as he thought his communication access revoked after being ousted from the League. Batman tells him he un-revoked it since he designed the communicators and informs him an ambulance is already on its way and directs Barry to the Advanced Science and Genetic Testing Laboratory in Canberra. Though confused, Barry complies.

                                Once there, Batman tells him he is on the wrong side and that he hasn't given up on him. Doctor Norris introduces herself to Flash and reveals the young man's identity, Mitchell Davis, Galaxor. The doctor then leads Barry to Mitchell's room, where he sees all the posters of the League and even a signed picture of Flash meeting Mitchell before he became Galaxor.

                                Horrified upon seeing the young man held the league in high regard, Flash doesn't respond when Batman asks him how Mitchell felt when his idols attacked and crippled him. Throwing his communicator aside, Barry flees.

                                Back on the Nullarbor, Barry comes across the body of a kangaroo, and realizes a truck driver probably struck it down without noticing. Seeing Galaxor in place of the animal, Barry asks himself what the League is doing. Unsure and uncaring, he races off, just wanting to run and not think.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 14</h5>
                                <p>Batman looks down on a bloody body in horror, his mind flashing back to the night his parents were murdered, as the feelings of loss, regret and pain overwhelm him once again. He can only think, "He's gone. I'm abandoned again. My son is dead."

                                Hours earlier, Gotham's news channel is covering a special report by twin news anchors detailing how the nation is divided over their feelings on Superman's current course of actions. They turn to their guest but it becomes clear something is wrong. In the Batcave, Nightwing is watching the program and calls to Batman.

                                Back in the newsroom, Two-Face steps out of the shadows, revealing he was drawn by the subject of the program and brandishes a gun before flipping his coin to decide which of the two anchors he kills...only for a blast of heat vision to destroy it before it can fall back into Two-Face's hand. Outraged and confused, Harvey points his gun at Superman, pleading to know which side the coin landed on. Refusing to answer, Superman instead crushes his weapon and lets the security guards subdue him.

                                Superman then checks on the anchors and starts to leave when one of them requests to ask him some questions. Superman recognizes her and the anchor reveals they met at the Pulitzer awards, when he was nominated as Clark Kent but lost to his wife. The anchor apologizes but says she was the better writer. Smiling, Superman agrees.

                                The anchor asks if Lois would approve of his new proactive role he's taking, and Superman admits he can only hope she would, as he is doing this for her. The anchor then asks if he did kill the Joker and Superman admits he did. She tells him there isn't a single soul who thinks he did the wrong thing but Superman disagrees.

                                Looking at the camera, Superman addresses Gotham, telling the people there is something sick in their city. In the Batcave, Batman orders Nightwing and Robin to ready the Batplane, which confuses Robin, all the while Superman continues to explain that he is in Gotham to remove the dangerous inmates of Arkham Asylum so that they never harm any of the people again. Nightwing realizes this as they rush towards the plane...only for Damian to question why that's a bad thing.

                                Batman refuses to argue with his son and orders him to get on the plane but Damian refuses, saying he'll only go if they help Superman destroy the Asylum. Batman decides to leave with only Nightwing, much to Damian's ire.

                                As they fly off, Nightwing asks if Batman understands Damian's point of view, but Batman only says Dick was never as stubborn as Damian.Bruce asks him if he understands why they can't let Superman do this, and Dick says he does, but only because Bruce has had longer to indoctrinate him, but admits he does understand.

                                At the Asylum, a doctor is thanking Superman, Wonder Woman and Cyborg for returning a bound Two-Face but Wonder Woman tells him they've lost faith in the facility and are removing the patients. The doctor protests and Batman agrees with him, saying the League does not get to decide. Batman stands between the League and the more dangerous patients, with Nightwing standing by him, staff at the ready.

                                Wonder Woman is unsurprised to see the two and tells Robin he was right. Damian agrees, saying his father is standing with the monsters. He tells Superman and Wonder Woman they shouldn't be much trouble, all the while Batman watches in shock.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 15-16</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 15</h5>
                                <p>Nightwing demands to know what Robin is doing, and the young teen defends himself, saying he is bringing criminals to justice and standing with Superman, Wonder Woman and Cyborg, while pointing out that Nightwing and Batman are standing with Killer Croc and a patient he does not recognize. Annoyed, the Calender Man proclaims his name and tries to remind Wonder Woman of an encounter they had on Easter but is disappointed when she doesn't respond. Superman understands that Batman won't stand aside but he makes it clear that he won't stop them from removing the Asylum's patients.

                                Batman tells him he shouldn't be in the Asylum with the more dangerous inmates and Victor Zsasz taunts the Man of Steel, asking him if he enjoyed the 'release' of murder. Wonder Woman then asks if Cyborg has control of the Asylum's security and when he confirms, she has him open Zsasz's cell despite Batman's protests. But before the killer can enjoy his freedom, he vanishes a split-second later.

                                Batman realizes the Flash is the culprit while a panicking Mad Hatter is taken next. The Riddler tries to say something but Cyborg orders him to be quiet while Batman demands to know from Superman where they are being taken. Superman reveals they are being taken to a more secure facility where they can't hurt anyone anymore.

                                Batman gives Cyborg a single warning not open another cell door but when Cyborg moves to open the Riddler's, Batman activates a virus he had implanted into Cyborg's systems, incapacitating him in a sudden burst of electricity. Wonder Woman and Robin plead with Batman to stop but he only watches, forcing Nightwing to deactivate the virus in an attempt to calm the situation down.

                                Outside the Asylum, Green Arrow brings a handcuffed Harley Quinn in, revealing she set fire to the Arrowcave. Arrow believes she'll be safe there from Superman but learns of the League and Batman's presence from an orderly. After Arrow races off, Harley sees Superman on one of the security monitors and quickly frees herself, knocking the guard out and taking control of the Asylum's security. She contacts a massive inmate underground and promises to free him if he'll destroy the Asylum for her.

                                As Cyborg recovers, he realizes Batman planted the virus in his system when they first met and moves to attack him when Green Arrow makes himself known by shooting an arrow between Batman and Cyborg. Batman asks if he's with the League and Arrow denies this, saying he's admitting someone. Harley's voice suddenly echoes from the speakers and she frees the inmates to let them have a fighting chance against Superman and the other heroes.

                                Suddenly, the room begins to shake and Solomon Grundy bursts from the floor. He snatches Robin and drags him underground, with Superman, Wonder Woman and Nightwing following after him while Batman is tackled by Killer Croc, only to watch helplessly as his son is dragged underground.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 16</h5>
                                <p>Harley Quinn gleefully watches the Arkham Asylum inmates attack the Justice League, though she asks them to go easy on Green Arrow, accounting it as Stockholm Syndrome. Batman is being held down by Killer Croc and Calendar Man while the Riddler prepares to crush his head with a large rock. While the Riddler pauses to think of a riddle to say, Green Arrow hits the back of his head with a boxing glove arrow, allowing Batman to headbutt Croc and break free from his grasp.

                                Meanwhile underground in the Asylum's basement, Solomon Grundy holds Robin by his head in one giant hand while Wonder Woman attempts to free the boy by stabbing the zombie's arm with her sword, this only prompts Grundy to backhand her with enough force to send her flying through several walls. The Flash races after her, leaving Superman and Nightwing to deal with Grundy.

                                Nightwing informs Superman of Grundy's undead status and lets him know that he doesn't have to hold back against the monster since he will just regenerate. Flying ahead of Nightwing, Superman cuts off Grundy's hand with his heat vision, saving Robin and then charges straight through the monster's chest in a burst of gore. Nightwing frees Damian from Grundy's severed hand, asking him if he's okay. Robin angrily declares he had the situation under control, with Nightwing jokingly agreeing.

                                Just then Batman descends from the hole above, asking Robin if he's okay. Nightwing answers for him, and then the Dark Knight orders them to head back up and return the inmates to their cells. Robin protests that they're not going back to their cells but Batman just snaps at him not to argue. When Nightwing asks what Batman is going to do, the Dark Knight holds up explosives, preparing to bring Grundy down before he can destroy the Asylum.

                                Nightwing thinks Grundy has been dealt with but the monster rises back up despite its grievous wound. Batman orders them to go as he charges Grundy, planting the explosives on his head and then detonating them as he lands, decapitating the zombie and finally bringing him down. Superman compliments his work and Batman tells him they need to get Grundy back into his cell where the power dampeners can keep him under control.

                                Back up top, Robin angrily beats into several inmates, especially the Riddler, venting his disgust for all of them out. Nightwing tries to calm him down, but Damian calls him as bad as Batman, saying that Superman is right in that criminals don't deserve their protection. Nightwing tells him that Robin isn't supposed to beat people while they're down. Enraged, Damian screams that Nightwing is not Robin anymore and to stop telling him what do before throwing one of his kali sticks at Nightwing.

                                The stick strikes Nightwing upside his head, dazing him and causing him to fall down and break his neck on a piece of rubble. Damian approaches Dick's body, shocked and horrified when he doesn't respond. Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash and Batman rise up from the basement, the Man of Steel declaring the riot over.

                                Batman sees Damian crouched over Nightwing's body, the boy crying and apologizing. Shocked and horrified, Bruce shoves his own son away from Dick's body. Damian continues to say he didn't mean it, with Superman comforting him. Batman can only look down on his deceased protege's body, his mind flashing back to the night his parents died as the same feelings of horror regret and pain rise up. Several heroes look deeply saddened and even Harley Quinn begins crying.

                                With heroes and Arkham inmates solemnly watching, Batman carries Nightwing's body out of the Asylum and into the rainy night, thinking to himself that he is alone and "My son is dead."</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 17-18</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 17</h5>
                                <p>Catwoman comes across the body of a purse-snatcher named Joey Gutton, her inner monologue revealing how Joey fell on hard times and was forced to resort to stealing to support his family. Catwoman sees that Joey was shot and heads off, using her whip to get higher into the city's rooftops, her thoughts revealing that ever since Superman killed the Joker common criminals have become terrified of being killed by the Man of Steel, with more common criminals dying every night, with Catwoman blaming Superman, as he had murdered a man and was not punished, with more people following his influence after this and taking it upon themselves to kill more criminals.

                                Selina breaks into a high-res apartment building, calling the owner a true criminal due to the fact he chose to save himself and get richer when he let his company fall, but chose not help any of his employees. She is there to rob his safe and give most of the riches inside to Joey's family, while keeping the jewels for herself. She is just finishing when she realizes she is no longer alone.

                                Whirling around, Catwoman sees Superman himself. Before they can say much, the penthouse owner suddenly shows up. Forced to flee without her loot, Catwoman dives out of the penthouse and into the city below. Superman catches her and safely deposits her onto the streets below but becomes dizzy all of a sudden, allowing Catwoman to flee into the sewers.

                                Her inner monologue reveals she stole a small sliver of kryptonite from Batman's cave on one of her many nights at the mansion and fashioned it into an earring. She doesn't get far when Superman uses his heat vision to force her to remove the earring. Selina accuses him of wanting to kill her but Superman denies this, explaining that he just wants to talk.

                                Catwoman listens and is horrified when he reveals Nightwing's death to her. She tells him to talk Bruce instead but Superman says he can't, which upsets Selina, saying they're both too stubborn. Superman pleads with her to go to Bruce and Selina agrees, but asks Superman to punish not just the dictators who murder innocents through but the heads of the greedy corporations that have taken peoples homes and money from them, she asks him to punish them for they are truly evil.

                                Later that night, Selina goes to Wayne Manor and tries the door. When no one answers, she picks the lock and enters the Manor. She finds Alfred alone in the dark, having drunk himself into a stupor in grief over Dick's passing. When he tries to attend to Selina, she tells she will be looking after him for a while.

                                Selina makes her way down into the Batcave where Batman is furiously punching a training pole, his knuckles bleeding from the repeated impacts. She takes off his mask and urges him to grieve as she embraces him, giving him the support he needs.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 18</h5>
                                <p>Batman and Catwoman are summoned to the Gotham Police Station by the Bat Signal, though Catwoman is reluctant to follow, unsure of the police's reaction to her with him. When they arrive at the station, they are not greeted by Gordon but the President and secret services. The President tells him he didn't know how else to contact him and that they need to talk in private.

                                Batman agrees but only if Catwoman accompanies him. The President leads the two to a secured room immune to Superman's sense. Along the way he offers his condolences to Batman for Nightwing's death but Catwoman tells him to change the subject. Once in the room, the President reveals Superman and Green Lantern are busy dealing with falling satellites over Russia, and the reveals that in the past week after removing the inmates from Arkham Asylum, Superman forced Israel and Palestine's leaders to negotiate peace terms or he would do it for them. While this happened, Wonder Woman repelled an invasion in Burma and Shazam and Green Lantern worked together to protect Syria from a missile barrage. Raven also terrified the warring tribes of Sudan into submission by summoning the image of her father, Trigon.

                                Catwoman doesn't understand how the Justice League preventing bloodshed is a bad thing, but both the President and Batman understand that while they can force temporary peaces, the reasons for the feuds remain and someone will have to enforce the peace. The President then correctly guesses that Batman knows why he came to him.

                                Batman knows that he thinks Superman will take over the world and the President wants him to stop him. The President asks Batman if he can do it. Batman thinks if Superman needs to be stopped, then he might be able to do it. Catwoman then reveals that she and Batman knew the President would contact them, with both telling him he needs to be a better leader so that the people will stop looking to Superman and condoning his actions.

                                Though the President is angered to think they are trying to enforce their will like Superman, Catwoman makes it clear when she says they're not telling him, but asking. Humbled, he promises he can only try.

                                Knowing they'll need a team to counter the League, the President hands Catwoman a folder containing files on potential candidates they can recruit who haven't joined Superman for their own reasons. Already possessing his own files on these heroes, Batman and Catwoman leave, both splitting up to begin recruiting.

                                In Starling City, Catwoman finds Black Canary battling some common thugs. After handling the thugs, Catwoman tells her that Batman wants to talk to her before asking about Harley Quinn being handcuffed in Green Arrow's cave. Annoyed, Black Canary tells her to drop it.

                                In Washington, Batman surprises Jefferson Pierce as he is working. Annoyed, Pierce asks him why he's there and Batman asks what he's working. Jefferson reveals he was commissioned by the Department of Housing to help find homes for survivors of Metropolis. Batman is grateful for his work and promises to help him but tells him he needs his help as Black Lightning.

                                The next day, Batman talks to a shadowed figure in the Batcave who informs him that 'they' are on their way. Thanking him, Batman tells him he is still unsure of who he can trust and asks the figure to keep his presence hidden. Understanding, the figure agrees.

                                Batman arrives before a large elevator and thanks his new allies for coming. Among them are Huntress, Black Canary, Green Arrow (Who makes it clear he hasn't agreed to anything but to talk), Black Lightning, Batwoman, Captain Atom and Aquaman.

                                As they sit down, Batman asks if they understand why he brought them here. Captain Atom responds and asks what they're plan of attack is against Superman and the League.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 19-21</h3>
                               <h5>Chapter 19</h5>
                                <p>Billy Batson, under the guise of a school project, goes around asking various civilians about how they feel about the Justice League's recent actions and whether what they're doing is right or wrong. He receives mixed answers, with some all for what they're doing and grateful for Superman killing the Joker while others are afraid. One older man asks Billy why he is asking this question.

                                The day before, Green Lantern is lying unconscious in the ruins of a destroyed city while Wonder Woman flies to meet with Cyborg, asking him if he has found Lantern and the Flash. On the ground Cyborg informs Wonder Woman that Flash is evacuating civilians when he finds Green Lantern and tells Wonder Woman he is down.

                                Wonder Woman asks if he can see his attacker but Cyborg can't because of all the smoke in the area. Wonder Woman then contacts Superman, but the Man of Steel is just recovering from his own attack and tells her the attacker got away. Just then Cyborg's scanners pick up a fast approaching object and he prepares his arm-cannon.

                                Before he has a chance to fire, the one who destroyed the city and attacked Green Lantern and Superman is revealed to be Black Adam, who rips off Cyborg's left arm and knocks him out with a single punch.

                                Back in the present, Billy asks two more people of they think the League is going to far. The first person, a man, says they need to come back to America and deal with corrupt politicians while the second, a foreign woman, laments how she has seen noble people seize power for good intentions but become corrupted. She says she came to America to escape that but fears the League will conquer the whole world and there will be no where to run.

                                The day before, Black Adam taunts Cyborg for interfering in his 'retribution' when he is kicked in the back by Wonder Woman, sending him into the boot of Superman and knocking him into a piece of rubble. The two then rush over and successfully hold him down with Shazam arriving and telling him he is finished. Black Adam fiercely refutes this, revealing that someone in the destroyed city fired a missile shell into Kahndaq, murdering innocents. Adam swears that as long as he is Kahndaq's leader and protector and has power, he will not stop.

                                Wonder Woman then proclaims that they will take his power from him. She has Shazam hold Adam down alongside Superman while she gets out her Lasso of Truth, wrapping it around Adam's neck and telling him as long as it touches him he can only speak the truth. Concerned, Shazam tells Wonder Woman if they compel Adam to speak his magic word, he may not survive returning to his ancient mortal form.

                                Letting Billy ask Adam if there is any other way to stop him from killing, Adam fervently declares they cannot, declaring he will slaughter whole countries if they threaten Kahndaq. Black Adam then tells them they are heading down the same path as he once did and while they may bring about peace, the people will fear them. Shazam turns away as Wonder Woman begins to ask Adam a question, and Black Adam pleads with Billy to promise him that he will protect Kahndaq. Wonder Woman then asks Adam what is his magic word and the Lasso of Truth forces Black Adam to cry out "SHAZAM!" turning him back into an ancient, barley alive mortal in a sudden bolt of lightning that knocks the three heroes aside. Wonder Woman covers his mouth as he tries to gasp out the word a second time.

                                Shazam sees a father huddling nearby with his two sons and tries to convince them the danger is gone but the man tells him they are surrounded by angry gods who would decide their future and pleads with Shazam to go back to the skies and not to pretend he understands them.

                                Back in the present, Billy admits he can understand them as he is a normal human most other times and reveals that he's been asking around about how they feel over the League's actions. He then has one last person to ask: His alter-ego, Shazam himself.

                                Shazam admits that he thinks both Superman and Wonder Woman have a chance to bring about real peace to the world, but Billy brings up their encounter with Aquaman and the Atlanteans and how they didn't know if Adam would survive his de-powerment. Billy admits that someone as young as him can't be exposed to this without being affected and that he may have found his answer.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 20</h5>
                                <p>One month has passed since the destruction of Metropolis and suddenly, several people begin to pick up a radio broadcast from within the ruins of the city, a broadcast that only says two words over and over: "I'm alive."

                                Aboard the Watchtower, Cyborg confirms to Superman that the radio signal broadcasting the recording is coming from Metropolis's ruins. Superman decides to investigate, but Wonder Woman and Green Lantern are quick to remind him that their recent actions have angered many powerful people, and that this is the setup for a perfect trap. Cyborg agrees with them but Superman refuses to ignore any potential survivor of Metropolis.

                                Cyborg then suggests that he not go alone, and both Wonder Woman and Green Lantern offer to accompany him on the grounds Hal's ring can shield him from the radiation and Wonder Woman would be unaffected due to her invulnerability. Though Superman briefly worries if it could be a trap, Lantern says he could use the backup. Cyborg then teleports them to Metropolis.

                                In the ruins of the City of Tomorrow, the three track the source of the signal underneath a toppled skyscraper and move it out of the way to continue underground. Green Lantern stays topside to guard the way down while Superman and Wonder Woman venture further underground. They discover a massive bunker that Superman is unable to peer inside due to lead shielding.

                                Superman and Wonder Woman find the source of the signal on a transmitter on the door when Wonder Woman suddenly feels like someone is watching them. Green Lantern suggests they leave and find another way to open the bunker, but Superman goes ahead and opens it on his own.

                                The Man of Steel is shocked to discover an equally surprised Lex Luthor alive and well inside the bunker.

                                Overjoyed, Clark hugs his friend, calling his survival a miracle. Lex corrects him, calling it a well executed contingency plan. He asks what has happened in his absence but Superman promises to tell him later, saying they have to get him out of there or risk exposing him to lingering radiation.

                                In an unknown location, Batman converses with an unseen individual, who confirms his suspicions that it was Luthor broadcasting the signal. Batman asks how Luthor survived and his ally reveals that a speedster on Luthor's payroll raced him into his bunker before the nuke detonated before she died trying to save more people. The individual says he couldn't get anymore information before Wonder Woman somehow sensed him. Batman warns the shadowed figure of Diana before asking where Lex is now.

                                On the Watchtower, Lex is meeting with the Justice League and after learning of their recent actions, he fully supports them and offers them help in planning and better preparing themselves to protect the world. Wonder Woman demands to know how they can trust him and to the shock of the entire League, he lists their secret identities to them and reveals he has always known who they are and has protected them for years, saying they've already trusted him without knowing it. He then says again that he would like to join them.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 21</h5>
                                <p>In Mogadishu, the president is touring the streets when Hawkgirl swoops down from the sky and snatches him out of his vehicle. Batman informs his contact via radio that they were right before Catwoman asks him if he's ready. Batman responds by ordering Captain Atom to grab the Mogadishu president from Hawkgirl, allowing Black Lightning to knock her out of the sky with a single blast of electricity and Huntress to knock her out with an arrow bolt.

                                As Batman and his team look down on the unconscious Hawkgirl, Catwoman dryly quips, "Well we're in it now."

                                Elsewhere, Wonder Woman is observing the refugee camp within Mogadishu, her inner monologue revealing that war and famine have left millions displaced and their shacks will not stand up to the coming rainy season which will destroy the poorly made tents and bring more disease. Wonder Woman is further angered by the fact that the men within the security force are causing the most pain to the women of the camps.

                                Disgusted by her's and the League's lack of action for them, Wonder Woman intervenes just as a woman is about to be attacked by the general of the forces and holds him by the neck with her Lasso of Truth. She orders the rest of his soldiers out as well as the women. She promises to women that she will take him away so that he will never harm them again but one of the victims points out that he will simply be replaced and the attacks will continue.

                                Agreeing with her, Wonder Woman then proceeds to crush the general's skull between her hands, killing him. One terrified soldier points his weapon at Wonder Woman but quickly lowers it on her command. Diana then has all the soldiers drop their guns and has the women pick them up. Diana promises the women she will return and that she will not abandon them to this life.

                                When one of the women asks what they do next, Wonder Woman only replies that that's up to her to decide. As Wonder Woman flies off, she coldly ignores the screams of the men as gunfire erupts.

                                Later, Diana returns to the Watchtower, and ignores Superman's questions over her absence and asks what has happened. The Flash explains that Hawkgirl was taken by Captain Atom, Black Lightning and Huntress. Wonder Woman suspects the U.S. government due to Atom's involvement but is confused by Huntress's presence. Lex Luthor immediately declares "It's Batman."

                                Though Green Lantern is quick to remind him Batman wasn't seen, Luthor only uses this to further his argument. Lex tells Superman that this is the beginning and that the League is spread too far apart, leaving them open to be picked off one at a time. When Superman asks what he's suggesting, Lex says they need more people and he may know how to get them.

                                In an unknown location, Catwoman and Batman are observing the captured Hawkgirl, with Catwoman questioning Bruce on how he knew where she was going to be. Batman replies that he can't tell her, though Selina argues against this. She then asks him if he's going to just keep Hawkgirl locked up, but Batman says he only needs her there for a single week. Catwoman is quick to remind him they'll come looking for her, but Batman again disagrees.

                                Back on the Watchtower, the Flash angrily states that they don't need to worry about recruiting more people but finding Hawkgirl. To the League's shock, Hawkgirl suddenly appears in front of all of them. Back in the unknown location with Hawkgirl still in her cell, Batman tells Selina the League won't even know she is missing.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 22-23</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 22</h5>
                                <p>When questioned about Batman releasing 'her', 'Hawkgirl' reveals Batman let 'her' go with a message to deliver to the League: "Stop working for the world and start working with the world." This is enough for both Shazam and the Flash to agree, with Flash pointing out that they've only been reacting since Metropolis, but haven't actually talked about what they're doing. Wonder Woman insists they're bringing the world to peace but Flash counters this, asking if the Atlanteans feel safer after their city was dropped in the desert.

                                Barry then looks to Superman, reminding him of Galaxor's crippling. Superman merely writes that off as "unpleasant" and argues that they've saved more lives than ever before. The Flash asks at what price and Wonder Woman tells him if he has that much doubt, he can leave. Shazam comes to his defense, saying what he's asking is far from unreasonable and reminds Wonder Woman that Black Adam could have died when they stripped him of his powers.

                                Wonder Woman reminds Billy that Adam destroyed an entire city, and Shazam says that while he wants to fight for the world, he doesn't want to bully it into submission. Superman attempts to say something but Shazam then asks him what kind of leader doesn't want to hear these kind of questions. As Shazam and Superman glare at each other, Robin, who was calmly watching from afar, comments that he can "Practically see the strings."

                                Damian then points out to them that this is his father's game, and he sent 'Hawkgirl' back to sow doubt among the League so they would fight among themselves. 'Hawkgirl' tries to defend 'her'self but Lex is quick to agree with Damian's words. Lex then suggests to Superman that it all comes down to communication and asks the Man of Steel to let him shape his message and present it to the people in a public address.

                                Though Shazam asks if this message comes solely from Superman, Clark disagrees and says that they all need to communicate with the world. Shazam thanks Superman and says he only wants to make sure they all don't become something they despise.

                                The scene shifts to the darkest corners of the universe, revealing Apokolips. Deep in the bowels of the hellish world, Kalibak calls to his father, Darkseid, asking to speak with him. The Lord of Apokolips is overseeing the torture of an unseen figure and learns from Kalibak of Superman's current course of peace on Earth. When he asks Kalibak if he thinks Superman has softened, and Kalibak asks to lead a war party to Earth to test this peace.

                                Kalibak then notices just who it is Darkseid is torturing. His father then gives him permission to invade Earth before telling Kalibak to leave so that he may resume his torture on the captive Black Racer.

                                Back on Earth in Paris, Lex checks up on Superman as he is finishing putting his suit over his uniform, with Lex assuring him this a job for Clark. Lex greets the massive gathered crowd in front of the Eiffel Tower before introducing Superman, with Wonder Woman and Shazam behind him, also dressed in civilian attire. Superman then gives a speech detailing his recent actions, apologizing for frightening them before explaining what they have done for the last month.

                                As he goes on to explain while he is an alien, he was raised by compassionate parents and that he believes in this world, that he is one of them. As the world watches on, with even the likes of Harley Quinn and Batman, Catwoman and Alfred watching from the Batcave, Superman explains that the message of this press conference is simple: They just want the people of Earth to be safe.

                                Just then, a massive Boom Tube opens behind the crowds of people, with hundreds of thousands of Parademons attacking the people. Superman is quick to rush to their defense, ordering Wonder Woman and Shazam to protect the people when he is attacked by Kalibak. Kalibak mocks Superman for believing he no longer wishes to fight, but when he sees the enraged expression on the Man of Steel's face, he can only utter, "Oh...****."</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 23</h5>
                                <p>A horrified Kalibak demands Superman to speak, deeply unnerved by his enraged expression. Superman's only response is to charge Kalibak at superspeed and uppercut him into the sky, straight through the wing of a plane. Superman calls to Wonder Woman to catch the nose-diving plane while he flies after Kalibak, hitting him again with enough force to create a thunderous sonic boom.

                                On the Watchtower, the rest of the League see the Boom Tube opening in Paris and quickly realize Apokolips is invading. Flash rushes to the teleporter, demanding that they leave to help but Cyborg quickly picks up multiple Boom Tubes opening across the world in Shanghai, Moscow, Mumbai and Istanbul with thousands of Parademons pouring out and attacking the populace.

                                In the Batcave, Batman informs his Insurgents that the Parademons are instigating a full-planetary invasion. Catwoman asks why they are attacking certain cities, and Batman replies that they're the most populated cities on the planet. Realizing this is about inflicting as much death as possible, he tells them Gotham City is next to be invaded.

                                Batman orders his team to head out to Gotham, though Catwoman is reluctant, Black Canary argues that while Captain Atom could defend a single city on his own, the rest of them have only fought against such odds before by working with other heroes and pleads with him to work with Superman.

                                Back in Paris, the Man of Steel has punched Kalibak back down to the ground, creating a massive crater. Landing atop the evil god, Superman demands that he call off the attack. Kalibak challenges him as to what he will do if he doesn't, and when Superman doesn't respond, Kalibak mocks him, saying he hasn't changed and while he has so much power no one fears him because his moral code prevents him from what has to be done.

                                Pulling out a Mother Box, Kalibak summons more Parademons behind Superman and pins him to the ground in a choke hold, saying if he is not prepared to take a life he cannot win a war. As the Parademons box over them, Kalibak further tortures Superman by forcing him to listen to the cries of all the dying people across the world. As Kalibak further mocks him for sparing his enemies, Superman closes his eyes as he hears more cries for help and whispers "Not again."

                                When he opens his eyes again, they burn red and Superman screams in fury as he unleashes a blast of heat vision so intense the Parademons are incinerated into ash and bones, with Kalibak knocked away from him.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 24-25</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 24</h5>
                                <p>All across the world, the Justice League and Batman's Insurgency struggle against the legion of Parademons, each hero vastly outnumbered as they struggle to fight the monsters and protect the civilians.

                                Outside of Paris, Superman stalks towards a terrified Kalibak, hoisting him up by his neck and demanding the god fight him. Kalibak pleads with the enraged Man of Steel, admitting defeat, but Superman refuses to accept his surrender and punches Kalibak, ordering him to fight back. Kalibak responds with a powerful double fist uppercut, but Superman is virtually unfazed, only a single line of blood running down his jaw.

                                Shocked and terrified as Superman asks him if he thinks he can come to the Earth and murder innocent people without answering for his crimes, Kalibak weakly protests that Darkseid will not allow him to be harmed, but Superman retorts that he can no longer hide behind his father. Infuriated, Kalibak attempts to punch the Man of Steel but his hand breaks when Superman catches his attack. Superman declares he has let 'creatures' like Kalibak live before, but vows no more mercy for "Men posing as cancers."

                                Lifting Kalibak up again, the son of Darkseid protests his immortality and proclaims his godhood. Superman attacks him three times, each blow stronger than the last and punctuated as Superman shouts, "I. DON'T. CARE!" and crushes Kalibak's head under his fists, killing him.

                                As the Flash attempts to save a woman in Mumbai, Superman suddenly appears before him, with time slowing down around them as they converse at super-speed. Though Barry hopes this can wait, Superman needs to talk to him alone, as attempting to talk to anyone else would let thousands die in the time it would take.

                                Superman tells the Flash what Kalibak told him concerning how he would spare his enemies in favor of saving lives. Barry tries to convince Kalibak's words aren't worth listening to Superman disagrees and says that needs to change and that they need to stop treating the invading Parademons with kid gloves.

                                Flash is shocked that Superman is suggesting they kill their enemies. Superman admits he doesn't want to, but he doesn't want to worry about the lives of the monsters murdering the innocent. Flash tells Superman that he has already made up his mind, and that if he came to him asking for permission to kill, Barry refuses to give it to him.

                                Superman sorrowfully asks Flash if he can think of any other way, and as the Man of Steel flies into the sky above, Barry sadly replies that he can't.

                                In outer space, Superman looks down on the Earth for a moment before charging back down at full speed, his eyes burning red.

                                All around the world, the Parademons are incinerated in an instant into ash that rains down on the survivors. Superman even saves Batman and his team from the monsters, though Bruce is horrified to realize how far Superman is now willing to go while Wonder Woman is pleased.

                                As Superman returns to Paris, Lex Luthor happily presents the Man of Steel to the survivors, who cheer and chant their savior's name.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 25</h5>
                                <p>On the Watchtower, Wonder Woman informs Superman that the people are celebrating and praises him for saving so many lives, while Kal-El can only focus on the lives that were lost. Though Wonder Woman calls his actions incredible, Superman declares it wasn't enough. Wonder Woman reminds him he can't be everywhere and Superman agrees, saying they can't be everywhere to enforce their peace and that they need to recruit more like them. Wonder Woman says there aren't any else like them when Lex Luthor walks in, retorting, "Not yet."

                                Simultaneously, Batman and Catwoman are observing the people's celebration, with Catwoman pointing out the people are chanting his name in worship. Batman can only focus on how many lives Superman had to take.

                                Later, Batman and Catwoman have called the rest of the Insurgents into a meeting in the Batcave. The Dark Knight is convinced there is no coming back for Superman after this, though Huntress counters that they were at war and Superman saved lives. Batman reminds her that Superman slaughtered thousands of Parademons to do so but Huntress retorts that the Man of Steel is a hero in the eyes of almost everyone on the planet...except Batman's.

                                Huntress then points out that Superman even saved Green Arrow and Black Canary's lives, with Ollie pleading to be left out of the argument. Huntress then declares, "Being sanctimonious and arrogant doesn't make you right, Bruce!"

                                A beat passes as Batman glares at Huntress who realizes there are those in the room currently unaware of his secret identity.

                                While Captain Atom is confused and Batwoman is bemused, Huntress is further annoyed that Batman hasn't even told the people's he's working with who he really is. She decides that she wants to leave, believing Superman is in the right but Catwoman calls her back and urges Batman to tell her Superman's plans. Batman reveals Superman and Lex Luthor are working together to create a personal army of super-soldiers. When Black Lightning asks him how he knows this, Batman refuses to say and Huntress asks him how he can expect them to trust him if he refuses to trust them.

                                Agreeing with her, Batman removes his cowl, revealing his identity as Bruce Wayne. Though Captain Atom and Green Arrow are shocked, Batwoman points out trouble in Gotham on the security monitor. Cursing the 'cultists', Batman orders Captain Atom to go ahead of them while the rest follow. As the Insurgents rush to their various vehicles, Green Arrow is still in disbelief that a 'flake' like Bruce Wayne is Batman, though after Black Canary comes to Wayne's defense, he realizes she knew his identity all along and is stunned she never told him. Dinah counters by reminding him he had Harley Quinn handcuffed in his Arrow Cave.

                                Captain Atom arrives in Crime Alley where dozens of fanatics wearing brown robes with Superman's crest sewn on them are attacking people, demanding they be cast out of Gotham. Batman explains to his team that after Superman murdered the Joker several fanatics followed his actions and began murdering small time criminals and after the Apokolips crisis, their numbers have grown and they worship Superman as a god.

                                Batman and his team work together in an attempt to subdue and force the cultists to leave but before they can, Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern arrive, with Diana ordering the cultists to disperse. Though Green Arrow argues with her that they were handling the situation, Diana disagrees and orders them to leave.

                                Superman flies down to stand face to face with Batman for the first time since their fallout during Atlantis' uprising, the Man of Steel and Dark Knight glaring at each other, but Catwoman manages to convince Bruce that this not the time or place and the Insurgents retreat.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 26-27</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 26</h5>
                                <p>Inside the Fortress of Solitude, Lex Luthor has completed the first of a series of pills that will allow Superman and the League to begin creating an army of super-soldiers. As Lex revels in his accomplishment, Jonathan Kent asks him if he's proud of what he's created. Lex explains to Jonathan that his son only wishes to ensure peace for the world and that he does feel proud for creating something with alien technology that will enhance the human race.

                                Martha Kent interjects that Clark doesn't need "some super-science pill" but someone to talk to. Lex insists that Clark is doing something beyond "mere mortal comprehension" but Martha snaps at him, saying that he's hurting worse than he ever has before, with Jonathan agreeing, saying that Clark lost his wife, his unborn child and his city, losing his control and now he's trying to take it back.

                                On the Watchtower, the Flash approaches Superman, arguing the ethics of allowing Lex Luthor to create a pill to manufacture super-soldiers, asking if that's what they do now. Superman clarifies that Lex was already working on the project before Metropolis's destruction and that he only provided the remaining Kryptonian tech to finish it. Superman concedes that it appears extreme and Flash snaps that it's mad scientist territory. Superman suddenly asks Barry if he plays chess.

                                Flash is caught off guard but after Superman asks him how fast he can learn, Barry quickly studies chess on the Watchtower's computer and he and Superman sit down for a game. As they contemplate the board, Superman asks how fast Flash can think, and he responds, "Very fast." The two play their first game at superspeed and Superman tells Barry he wants to discuss ideas with him, and as the Man of Steel checkmates the Flash, he tells him, "I want to get rid of guns."

                                Back in the Fortress of Solitude, Martha is telling Lex a story of Clark's childhood, where he carried a red blanket around with him all the time, but when he lost it one day, he threw an enraged tantrum and accidentally knocked over an eight-hundred pound tractor, revealing to his shocked parents and Clark himself his unique abilities. When Lex asks if she thinks Superman is acting like a scared child, Martha smiles gently before replying, "Aren't we all?"

                                As they play another game at superspeed, Superman tells Flash that together they both could remove all of mankind's guns, though Barry is unconvinced they could get all the guns, but Superman says they could get most before checkmating Barry again. Barry argues that just because they can do it doesn't mean they should, saying they must willingly give up their guns or they will resent them. Superman says they will alive to resent them.

                                As they play another match, Flash tells him the people will rise against them, and Superman tells him, "Let them come at use with sticks."

                                Back in the Fortress, Lex places the newly created super pill in a container while asking the Kents if they think their son's recent actions are "Some sort of super-tantrum?" Jonathan tells him this goes beyond that and then asks Lex, "You're supposed to be the smartest man on Earth. Are you honestly telling me that you can't see that Clark needs help?"

                                Lex is silent, truly unable to respond as Martha reminds him despite all the incredible things Clark can do, he is still just a man and that he can make mistakes.

                                Back on the Watchtower, Flash asks Superman what they do after guns, and Superman asks him what else claims more lives than guns. Barry responds, "Smoking." Confused, Superman listens as Flash explains cigarettes kill more people than guns and says, "Tomorrow we get rid of cigarettes." Before claiming his first checkmate on Superman. Flash then goes on to say if that's how they want to save the world, that's what they must do before saying, "Then we imprison anyone who speeds a car." as he gets another checkmate.

                                Barry continues to win more games as he explains how far they have to go to maintain peace by imprisoning and eventually killing people for increasingly petty crimes if they do such acts.

                                Back in the Fortress of Solitude, the Kents continue to explain that their son is just as fallible as the rest of them. Lex explains that he wants to believe in Superman's cause and ensure that what happened to Metropolis does not happen again. Martha asks him if he feels guilty for surviving after so many others died during the catastrophe. Lex replies with a somber, "Yes."

                                Martha tells him to look around the interior of Clark's Fortress, pointing out the memorials of his birthparents and Krypton, as well as the picture of Lois, explaining that because Clark has lost so much, she believes he could lose anything else and live with himself. Jonathan reveals that's why they're in the Fortress, because Clark believes by keeping them there he is keeping them safe. Jonathan fears that his son may try to bottle the whole world into his Fortress to keep it safe.

                                Lex asks them what they would have him do, and Jonathan tells him, "When the time comes, I expect you to do what's right." He then points to the newly created pill and explains that Lex has created the means to stop Clark and that it can give power back to the people. As Superman contemplates the chessboard, his father goes on to explain that he fears there may come a day when the world needs to be saved from his own son, and that he asks Lex to find a way to save Clark as well.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 27</h5>
                                <p>On the Watchtower, Lex Luthor is wrapping up his presentation and explanation of the new super-pill created from Kryptonian nano-tech and explains on how it can enhance strength and durability in those that ingest it. Robin can only grasp the pills as magic, with Luthor trying to explain how Superman and he had come up with the idea, but Robin is uninterested.

                                Superman interjects and says that he is sure there are a number of people they can trust to give the pills to, with Luthor suggesting they draw up a list of candidates. Green Lantern is perturbed by the idea but both Superman and Lex are convinced they need more people on the ground to prevent more lives from being lost in another event like Apokolips' invasion. Green Lantern suggests they're trying to form an army, but Luthor calls it more of a peace-keeping force similar to the Green Lantern Corps.

                                'Hawkgirl' suddenly points out that most world governments won't see it that way, and asks what would happen if the pills fell in the wrong hands. Superman assures 'her' that the technology will not fall into the wrong hands and that the pills are not only about protecting the world, but protecting them by making them stronger.

                                Later, Robin is seen stealing the pill sample and using the Watchtower teleporter to go to Gotham City. Unknown to him, he is observed by 'Hawkgirl'...

                                Robin is next seen standing in front of a display case containing Nightwing's costume, with a mourning Damian apologizing to it before jumping in shock as he realizes someone is behind him. Realizing it's Alfred, the butler comments that he shouldn't be surprised that Damian is on edge. Alfred then asks him if he received his letter, which Damian confirms and Alfred is pleased, noting how hard it was to "find a zip code in outer space".

                                He asks if Damian was ever going to write back and Damian replies that he tried, but found it too hard. Alfred agrees on this. Suddenly, the Batmobile races into the cave and as Batman steps out, he demands to know what Damian is doing there. Damian decides to leave while Batman simply heads off, but Alfred calls to Damian to stay and harshly whispers to Bruce that his son is guilt-ridden and seeking redemption and forgiveness for Dick's death and urges Bruce, "Not to be you."

                                Bruce calls to his son to wait and after sharing a look with Alfred tells him, "I just want to talk." Damian reminds his father that he left him at Arkham after Dick's death, with Bruce reminding him he chose to stand against him. Damian is insistent that Superman is in the right and that Batman is wrong, but that he's too conceited to see it. Batman reminds him that this is not about him, but Damian angrily declares that it's always been about him and his crusade and his "impossible standards".

                                Alfred tries to calm the boy down and urges him to hear his father out, but Damian, enraged, harshly shoves Alfred away, knocking him into the Batcomputer's monitor, smashing it and injuring Alfred. Damian is shocked while Bruce is horrified.

                                In a rage, he stalks closer to his son but Damian pushes him away as well, straight into the giant penny. The massive coin begins to fall over, threatening to crush Alfred, when it is suddenly stopped by 'Hawkgirl', who catches it and pushes it back with ease. Damian checks on Alfred, but Alfred only asks about Bruce, who is rising back up, no worse for the wear. 'Hawkgirl' suggests to Damian that they return to the Watchtower but Batman orders 'her' to leave him, which 'she' complies to.

                                Damian is confused by the fact she is listening to him, before quickly putting together the situation and realizing that this 'Hawkgirl' isn't the real Hawkgirl and pulls out incendiary grenade and throwing it at 'Hawkgirl', exposing 'her' as the Martian Manhunter. After J'onn tells Batman he's fine, Bruce chases after his son, but curses when sees Damian has escaped through the Batcave's teleporter.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 28-30</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 28</h5>
                                <p>On the Watchtower, Wonder Woman has finished informing the gathered group of Flash, Luthor, Cyborg and Superman what Robin has told her: That his father had Hawkgirl kidnapped and replaced with the Martian Manhunter to spy on them. When Cyborg wonders where the real Shiera is, Superman tells him Batman still has her. The Flash is in disbelief that Batman would do this, calling it crazy by even his standards, but Robin tells him this is something his father would do.

                                Damian explains to them how none of them know his father or the lengths he would go to. He is adamant that Batman would strike first. Lex tells Superman they need to bring everyone back to the Watchtower so they can protect everyone and form a plan, but Superman replies that that's what Batman would want. Refusing to allow Batman any advantages, Superman has Cyborg open all emergency broadcast systems across the entire planet.

                                Superman addresses the entire planet, explaining Batman's actions of kidnapping Hawkgirl and replacing her with Martian Manhunter, calling him a traitor for his actions. Batman watches the broadcast on the Batcomputer, but when he hears Superman declare he will take his 'anonymity', Bruce curses his old friend before initiating the 'Icarus Protocol'.

                                The broadcast is knocked out just as Superman prepares to reveal the Dark Knight's identity.

                                On the Watchtower, the League is shocked as the station's systems all go offline, including the teleporters and life-support. Lex tries to tell Superman and Wonder Woman what to do to safely land the Watchtower on Earth before they run out of oxygen, but Superman refuses, understanding that this is merely a ploy by Batman to buy time to protect his identity. He goes to Cyborg, but he tells the Man of Steel with the power out the station's communications are out as well.

                                Damian then looks to Lex and Cyborg and taunts them on how they can't put "four little words" online. The two exchange looks and in the next panel, a Superman twitter account has opened with a single post: Bruce Wayne is Batman, which quickly circulates before over three million favorites and two million re-posts, exposing the Dark Knight to the world.

                                Satisfied, Superman declares they can bring the Watchtower down safely now. As she straps Damian in, Wonder Woman compliments his courage before helping Superman push the Watchtower down to Earth, landing it safely.

                                In the Batcave, Alfred enters to inform Batman of a 'ludicrous' amount of newscopters circling the mansion above. Batman apologies to Alfred, but his oldest friend was always ready for this day and reveals he has made a list of items to remove from the mansion in case they ever needed to vacate quickly. Batman thanks him and tries to suggest he should leave but Alfred brushes his offer off, reminding him he's the first thing on the list.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 29</h5>
                                <p>Five minutes from now, a bleeding Wonder Woman pleads with Superman to burn her with his heat vision. Complying with little hesitation, Superman unleashes a blast of heat vision that causes Wonder Woman to scream in agony.

                                In the present, Superman leads a small group consisting of himself, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and the Flash through Gotham City to Batman's Batcave, with Superman assuring them that they are just going to talk to Batman to secure Hawkgirl's release. Green Lantern quips that they're "a lot of big guns" for a conversation, though Flash reminds him it's still a conversation with Batman.

                                They arrive outside the Batcave's Waterfall entrance, with Wonder Woman reminding them that the Dark Knight will be expecting them and that he will be angry at them for releasing his identity. Flash wonders if they're suppose to 'knock', with Wonder Woman offering too, when Superman tells her not to bother, telling them he's coming. Batman steps out, only saying "You took my life." Wonder Woman tells him to buy another and demands to know where he is holding Hawkgirl. When Batman tells her he isn't holding her, Diana becomes angry, telling him they know about Martian Manhunter and his deception, but then she is contacted by Cyborg who tells her Hawkgirl has arrived at the crashed Watchtower.

                                Lex lights up a match and shows it to Shiera to make sure she is not Manhunter in disguise yet again, and Shiera proves her identity by easily putting it out.

                                With her identity confirmed, Flash suggests they just leave but Wonder Woman warns Bruce if he continues to interfere in their mission they will respond with greater force. Ignoring her, Batman turns to walk away and the Flash blocks him from the Batcave, telling him he can't walk away. Agreeing, 'Bruce' suddenly flies into the sky, revealing himself as the Martian Manhunter the whole time.

                                Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Superman fly after him but the martian vanishes after flying through a cloud. Lantern attempts to locate him by scanning the area with his ring, but Hal is knocked out of the sky by a single punch from Martian Manhunter, forcing Wonder Woman to fly after him. Alone, Superman addresses J'onn and the martian appears, addressing Clark by first name as well.

                                J'onn tells Superman that Batman left the cave and was long gone. When Kal-El asks J'onn why he sided with Batman over him. J'onn answers "Because of what you could become." When Kal-El demands to know what that is, J'onn projects images of his own past on Mars being suppressed by the White Martians, with J'onn helpless as he is forced to watch his daughter be taken from him.

                                J'onn tells Kal-El that this is what it feels like to be suppressed and ruled by a stronger species, to be feel helpless. Kal-El sees himself reaching for Lois's body as J'onn tells him that he knows this feeling.

                                Before J'onn can say anything else, Wonder Woman grabs him by the head, angrily demanding he get away from Superman. J'onn suddenly shapeshifts his body into a liquid state and forcibly entering her body, lamenting how she never trusted him before reminding them they have always underestimated him, seeing themselves as invulnerable but now he is inside her and he can choke her organs.

                                When J'onn tells Diana he knows how much she's changed and threatens to kill her by cutting off the oxygen to her brain, Diana pleads with Superman to burn her. Without a moment's hesitation, Superman unleashes an intense blast of heat vision, forcing a screaming J'onn out of her body. The Martian Manhunter is reduced to ashes in moments.

                                A shocked Wonder Woman tells Superman that J'onn would have killed her but Superman tells her he knew and they fly off, never realizing they were being observed by Batman, who leaves as well.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 30</h5>
                                <p>Six years ago, Superman helped a young boy who had fallen off his bike, denting his wheel. After attempting to repair the wheel (only to stretch it out further), Superman offers to fly the boy home instead, much to his delight. The two fly over Metropolis and when Superman drops the boy off at his apartment home, he manages to convince the Man of Steel for another short flight around the block.

                                The boy offers Superman to come inside but the Man of Tomorrow politely declines and suddenly dashes off. Superman stops two men from attempting a bank robbery.

                                Back at the boy's home, his mother has gotten back from work and is annoyed at the damage to his bike as well as his claims of meeting Superman.

                                Atop the Daily Planet later that evening, Superman meets up with his wife, Lois Lane, with both informing each other explaining why they'll be home late (Foiling a bank heist that could collapse the economy for Lois, helping a boy fix his bike for Clark) before exchanging a kiss and departing.

                                As the mother applies bandages to the boy's cut and scraps, she answers the door and is shocked to see Superman with a new wheel for her son's bike.

                                In the present, the boy, now a young man in college at Gotham, expresses his sadness at Superman's current personality and actions, finding himself missing the Man of Yesterday and his home in the City of Tomorrow.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 31-32</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 31</h5>
                                <p>In the middle of the night, the President of the United States receives a call from Batman on his private cellphone. The Dark Knight informs him of a situation and requests the President cause a distraction for him.

                                Meanwhile, Black Canary and Green Arrow have arrived outside of a unisex bathroom, having been given the address by Batman to meet up there, with Arrow bickering about only being trusted with the number three (for a stall) and Canary having been trusted with the whole address. They are both stunned when a toilet begins reacting to the sounds of their voices before their retinas are scanned and the stall is revealed to an elevator which descends into the underground hideout Batman has prepared.

                                When they arrive, they see the Dark Knight in an argument with Black Lightning over the fact he was uniformed of their kidnapping and replacing of Hawkgirl with Martian Manhunter. Canary, Huntress and Captain Atom are in agreement with Lightning's anger and concerns, despite Batman's assurance that he was never going to hold Shiera indefinitely. The gathered heroes are stunned to learn of Martian Manhunter's death at Superman's hands, before Batman informs him that someone from the League made contact with him to inform him of the completion of the super-soldier nanotech pill and that it is being manufactured at Superman's Fortress of Solitude.

                                Though Green Arrow is incredulous at the idea of breaking into Superman's Fortress, Batman believes that acquiring the pills are the only way to keep the balance of the world in their favor, as well as the fact the pills may be the world's only chance against Superman. Batman suddenly receives a text message and let's his team know their distraction is happening: U.S. Warships heading for the Korean Peninsula, a distraction too big for Superman and the League to ignore.

                                Batman starts towards the teleporters to take them to where the Fortress of Solitude is located, calling Catwoman, Black Canary and Captain Atom after him, Green Arrow angrily demands to come along, refusing to let Dinah go by herself. Though Batman tries to explain his reasons, Ollie refuses to listen, but Dinah manages to break up their fight and Arrow decides to accompany them.

                                In the North Pole, Batman has Captain Atom fly Catwoman to the Fortress ahead of them, noting that Superman and the League should be in Korea by now to intercept the warships.

                                But unknown to Batman, Superman has instead gone to the White House to directly confront the President over the matter instead.

                                When Batman and his team arrive outside the Fortress, they see Catwoman has managed to unlock the front door for them, and Captain Atom pulls it open to allow them inside.

                                Back at the White House, Superman confronts the President, but quickly realizes something is off and looks away, scanning the world with his super extra senses before suddenly flying off.

                                Back at the Fortress, Batman is shocked when he sees Superman's parents inside the Fortress, and calls off the mission. When Green Arrow demands to know why, Batman explains that in Superman's current state of mind he will react with extreme violence if he feels his parents are being threatened. Batman realizes they're too late to leave as he receives another text message.

                                The Dark Knight tries to warn Captain Atom, but is horrified to see an enraged Man of Steel clutching Atom by his neck, his eyes burning with barely restrained heat vision.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 32</h5>
                                <p>As Superman glares at Batman and his team, his parents try to calm him down, but the Man of Steel is too furious to listen. Captain Atom then decides Superman has used his one chance and blasts him away with a nuclear burst, causing a cave in at the front of the Fortress, separating Green Arrow from the rest, leaving him trapped inside the Fortress with Superman's parents. Black Canary refuses to leave her lover but Ollie manages to convince her too, and Batman informs him of a locator he placed inside his hood, promising to come back for him after Superman has retreated.

                                Meanwhile, Captain Atom and Superman are locked in a heated battle, with both roughly evenly matched until Captain Atom strikes Superman so hard he brings the Man of Steel to his knees. Informing Superman that the Pentagon always thought he could take him, Captain Atom explains the reason he never did was because he always fought for his country and did as he was ordered, but as he prepares to deliver the final blow, he tells Superman that his orders have changed.

                                Before he can finish Kal-El, Atom is struck in the neck by Wonder Woman's sword, piercing the alien alloy covering his body and containing his power. Informing her of her blunder and its consequences, Atom decides to do the right thing and use this as his last opportunity to take Superman out. Grabbing Superman by the neck, Atom flies into the upper atmosphere, his body glowing brighter as he continues to leak nuclear power, with Wonder Woman in close pursuit.

                                In outer space, Captain Atom detonates right next to Superman, the blast so intense and powerful it knocks Wonder Woman back down to Earth below.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 33-34</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 33</h5>
                                <p>A narration reveals that Captain Atom's explosion carried the force of a seven megatons but ultimately failed. A battered and bloodied Superman awakens, still floating in space, before flying back down to Earth, straight for the North Pole. Spotting a crater, Kal-El is horrified to find Wonder Woman, badly injured and unconscious from the blast. Superman contacts Cyborg at the downed Watchtower, requesting medical evacuation for Diana.

                                Cyborg sends the Flash before asking Superman if he needs backup. Superman declines, and seconds later Flash arrives, asking what happened. A stunned Superman can only reply that 'they' tried to kill him. When Barry asks who, Superman responds that it was Captain Atom on orders from the U.S. Government, and Batman. Flash is shocked, having believed Batman incapable of attempting murder and he picks up Wonder Woman.

                                Superman agrees before telling Barry she is stable but needs medical attention. Flash thinks Superman does as well but Kal-El refuses to leave until he knows his parents are safe. With that said he orders Flash off.

                                Superman then enters his Fortress by punching through a wall, arriving in the main chamber where his parents and Green Arrow are. Superman orders Ollie away from his parents, with his mother greatly concerned by Kal-El's burned and injured appearance. When Superman explains to her that he believes the U.S. Government ordered his execution, he asks Ollie if he knows anything about that.

                                Thinking fast, Ollie tries to joke and bluff in an attempt to calm Kal-El down, all the while reaching for one of the super-pills. Superman easily sees this and burns away the corner of the table where they lay, seemingly preventing Ollie from grabbing one. With no other choice, Ollie draws his bow and arrows, hoping to distract Superman as he fires one- only for the arrow to bounce off Superman's invulnerable form and impale Jonathan Kent in the shoulder.

                                Enraged, Superman backhands Green Arrow with enough force to send him through a large crystal, badly injuring him. Knowing he stands no chance, Ollie fires off one last arrow over an advancing Superman's shoulder, the arrow flying straight through the hole the Man of Steel made in breaching the Fortress.

                                Waiting by the teleporter several miles from the Fortress, with Catwoman pleading to Black Canary that they have to go, with Dinah hopeful for Ollie's return. Batman suddenly picks up the signal for Ollie's tracker and they race ahead to locate it. To Dinah's dismay, all they find is an arrow with the tracker...and one of the super-pills. Dinah gives the pill to Batman, who offers to keep waiting, but a somber Black Canary tells him not to bother, as she knows he's not coming.

                                Back in the Fortress, Green Arrow lays dying at a furious Superman's feet, though his last thoughts are of Black Canary before he finally passes away.</p>
                                <h5>Chapter 34</h5>
                                <p>Superman continues to pulverize Ollie's corpse in a furious rage when his mother suddenly catches his arm, telling him to stop. Kal-El is shocked momentarily before realizing she took one of the nanotech pills. Looking towards the pills, Superman is shocked to see another one missing and realizes Batman has taken one.

                                With the Insurgents, Batman, Catwoman and Black Canary return to their hideout, expressions somber, with Batwoman asking them if they obtained the tech. Batman silently places the single pill down for all to see when Huntress asks where Captain Atom and Green Arrow is. Dinah leaves suddenly, concerning Helena, and causing Black Lightning to ask what happened.

                                Collecting the pill, Batman tells them that Superman is no longer they knew and is gone. He then orders them to find someplace to hide, believing the Man of Steel will soon be looking for all of them. As he moves towards the teleporter, Batwoman asks him where he is going, and Batman reveals he is returning to the Batcave to analyze the pill so they can learn what it's made of and synthesize more of them, still believing the pill is their only chance to stand against Superman and his followers.

                                Catwoman is horrified, realizing that with Superman after them, the Cave will be the first place he will go looking for him, but Batman is already aware of this and resigned to go.

                                Back in the Fortress of Solitude, Superman is attempting to leave, much to the shock of his father, who is still injured. Superman tries to reason with him but Jonathan is disgusted that he would leave him like this. Before they can further argue, the program of Jor-El materializes, calling to his son, shocked that he has committed murder within the Fortress. Superman tries to convince his father that he had no choice, but Jor-El responds, "There is always a choice."

                                Back with the Insurgents, Batman is trying to convince Selina that all he needs is enough time to analyze the pill. Catwoman continues to try and convince him to let some of them come along to help him, with Bruce arguing that he'll have a better chance alone. Selina gets fed up and demands that he let her help, pleading with him, reminding him that Superman isn't human and that he is. Before she can argue further, Bruce passionately kisses her before apologizing and knocking her out with an inhalant.

                                He hands Selina's unconscious body over to Batwoman before telling the rest of them to hide, promising to find them if his plan works.

                                Back in the Fortress of Solitude, Jonathan is kneeling by Ollie's body and asking Kal-El if he was his friend. Superman tries to justify his actions by reminding his adoptive father that Ollie had hurt him, though Jonathan says it wasn't Ollie's fault. Agreeing, Superman rationalizes that it was Batman's fault for everything that's happened, starting with the Joker's actions that led to Metropolis's destruction.

                                He argues that Bruce is trying to undo all the good he's done by stopping wars, though Jor-El tries to remind him that humanity must decide it's own fate. Superman's parents try to convince him to not go after Batman but the Man of Steel flies off, angry but determined. Martha then looks to Jor-El and apologizes for failing to raise his son properly. Jor-El can only apologize in turn for unleashing his son on their world before offering a comforting hand to the Kents.</p>

                                <h3>Chapter 35-36</h3>
                                <h5>Chapter 35</h5>
                                <p>In the Batcave, Batman begins to have the Batcomputer scan the nanotech pill when he is contacted by an unknown person via the Batcomputer itself. The person warns Batman of Superman's approach and urges him to escape, ignoring the Dark Knight's demands to reveal his identity. Batman refuses when he sees the analysis is not yet complete, and the person yells that Superman is coming.

                                Batman disagrees as the voice cuts off, and Superman is revealed to have already arrived.

                                The Man of Steel tells the Dark Knight that he had thought he had removed all of Gotham's madmen, but 'left the original' and says that like them, Batman would see the world burn. Bruce turns his back to Kal-El, calling him delusional. Enraged, Superman grabs Batman by his cape and lifts him easily off the floor, warning him to watch how he speaks. Unimpressed, Batman asks him why he is here and Superman tells him he has come to end this.

                                Batman disagrees, arguing that if Superman had really wanted to kill him, he would have just lobotomized him from outer space with his heat vision before he suddenly asking Kal-El if it's Ollie's blood he's covered in. Superman tries to say something but Batman reminds him that Green Arrow was the compassionate friend they had and dares Kal-El to justify his death. Batman then reveals the reason he thinks Superman has come to the cave: He thinks Batman can stop him, and that deep down he wants him to.

                                Screaming, Superman throws Batman across the cave, yelling at Bruce to stop talking. Rising back up, Batman tells him that it would be easier if he stopped talking, if he 'put on a giant metal suit' and hit Kal-El over and over, or exposed him to kryptonite so he could feel pain. Bruce apologies for the 'anti-climax' but refuses to fight Kal-El, reasoning that he thinks he can't defeat Superman without killing. Pressing a button on the Batcomputer, Batman tells Kal-El, "And I'm not like you. I'm not a murderer."

                                The Batcomputer begins playing a recording of Clark and Lois's wedding, and Superman demands Batman turn it off, but finds the Dark Knight has vanished into the shadows, his voice echoing all around him as he lectures his fallen friend for failing to protect Lois like he once vowed. Superman snaps back that it was Batman who failed but Batman then asks him if he believes he is honoring Lois by going to the extremes he has in the past year.

                                Superman rages that he is doing all this for Lois, but Batman responds by telling him that when Lois died, he lost his connection to, and his own, humanity. Superman darkly glares up in the cave rafters where Batman hides and tells him he's done being lectured, before ordering Bruce to step out of the shadows.

                                As the analysis of the pill gets closer to completing, Batman agrees, pulling out a device before telling Superman that it's time to 'even things up' and give him what he wants. Dropping the device which begins emitting sonic waves that greatly pain Superman, Batman drops from the rafters as bats swarm about, rushing to the nanotech pill while Superman burns the bats with his heat vision. The Dark Knight lunges out, hand grasping for the pill-

                                Only for the Man of Steel to grab his wrist, just mere inches from the pill. Kal-El rips off a shocked Bruce's cowl, agreeing with him that he's not there to kill him, but can no longer allow Bruce to be in a position that he can use to hurt him or the world. Lifting the struggling human easily into the air with both hands, Bruce pleads to Clark by name-

                                Only for Kal-El to slam Bruce down on his knee, the mortal screaming in agony as his back breaks under the Man of Steel.</p>

                                <h5>Chapter 36</h5>
                                <p>After breaking Bruce's back, Kal-El drops him onto the floor, apologizing but stating Bruce is just too dangerous. Painfully looking up, Bruce sees the analysis of the nanotech pill is complete and attempts to force himself up. Superman advises him not to, saying he can't and that he's going to put him away along with the 'other monsters from Gotham' and to accept it. When Bruce still tries to rise up, Kal-El pushes him down with his foot, ordering him to stay down.

                                Telling him it's over, Kal-El tells Bruce to stop fighting him. Bruce wryly glares up at his crippler and tells him he wasn't trying to fight him, but distract. Confused, the Man of Steel looks to the scanner and sees the pill before demanding to know what Bruce has done. Grinning in his Pyrrhic victory, Bruce explains that he has given humanity a fighting chance now that they know how to synthesize it. Enraged, Superman applies painful pressure to Bruce's back to force him to reveal where he uploaded the information to and who has it.

                                In agony but refusing to give in, Bruce tells Kal-El that he wants him to remember this day when he resorted to torture for 'the greater good'. Shocked, Kal-El steps back, trying to explain, but Bruce refuses to listen, telling Kal-El he isn't a hero, 'just another thug'. A shocked Kal-El is completely off guard when he hears someone call his name and touch his shoulder.

                                Turning around, the Man of Tomorrow is surprised to see Alfred...and fails to see the pill is now gone.

                                Alfred suddenly headbutts the Man of Steel, shattering his nose in a spray of gore. Dazed, Kal-El collapses onto his back while Alfred expresses his great disappointment in him before viciously pummeling the fallen Superman with kicks and punches, screaming that he will never hurt his family again.

                                With Superman beaten, Alfred cleans his hands before collecting his master and carrying him to the teleporter, informing Bruce as Kal-El struggles to get up that there is 'nothing worth saving here'.

                                The next day, Superman and the Justice League stands before the United Nations, explaining that the 'terrorist' Batman has stolen the nanotech pill and intends to use it against the planet. Superman swears that they will be watching over the world and not allow Batman to bring fear to the population. As his growing army marches into the U.N., Superman explains the last thing Lois ever told him was to save the world.

                                Looking on, Superman vows to, whatever it takes, ending year one of the series.</p>
