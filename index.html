                                <h3>BABY :D</h3>
                                <p> Chapter 1: The first chapter opens in the time period of the game, as Batman reflects on Superman's tyrannical regime. From there, the story flashes back five years previous. Superman (who is married to Lois Lane in this version of the DC Universe), learns that Lois is pregnant and reacts with a mixture of excitement and fear. However, a news tip leads Lois and Jimmy Olsen to the Metropolis docks, where they're ambushed by Joker and Harley Quinn. Joker immediately shoots and kills Jimmy.    Chapter 2: While Batman investigates a theft at STAR Labs, Superman discovers Jimmy's body and the bloody playing card Joker left at the scene. Superman frantically pleads for Batman's help, who calls in the entire Justice League to assist in the search. Flash leads Batman to Scarecrow's secret laboratory, where they find that the villain has been poisoned by Joker's toxin. Wonder Woman learns from a dock worker that Joker and Harley are hiding in a submarine. Superman confronts the duo, but is dosed with a toxic gas and is attacked by what looks to be Doomsday.    Chapter 3: Superman immediately begins battling Doomsday and carries him into space. Joker and Harley attempt to flee their submarine (which Harley named Gunter), but are apprehended by the Justice League. Batman discovers that Joker stole Scarecrow's fear toxin, laced it with Kryptonite, and used it to infect Superman. Joker also reveals that he hid a nuclear warhead in the center of Metropolis, programming it to detonate once Lois' heartbeat stops. In orbit, Superman realizes too late he had been brainwashed into attacking his wife, not Doomsday. As Lois and her unborn child both die in the vacuum of space, the warhead detonates and destroys Metropolis.     Chapter 4: Superman mourns Lois' death amid the ruins of Metropolis while the Justice League rescue survivors from outlying areas. Meanwhile, Batman interrogates Joker in a Gotham City prison. Joker reveals that he targeted Superman because he was tired of losing to Batman and wanted "to play on Easy Mode for a while." Despite Green Lantern's efforts to stop him, Superman flies to the prison and punches Joker through the chest while the villain dies laughing.     Chapter 5: Harley Quinn escapes police custody and returns to Joker's secret hideout, mourning the death of her "puddin'." Green Arrow quickly tracks her down and takes her into custody, hoping to prevent her from being Superman's next murder victim (as much for Superman's own sake as for Harley's). He drives her to his Arrow Cave, which is impervious to Superman's X-ray vision. Harley admits that she knew Joker was an evil man but couldn't help loving him anyway. Before departing, Green Arrow cheers Harley up by giving her his best maniacal laugh.      Chapter 6: Superman continues to mourn the loss of his family and city in the Fortress of Solitude. News broadcasts of a civil war in the Middle Eastern country of Bialya compel him to intervene. Superman rescues a group of civilians and kidnaps the Bialyian president. Wonder Woman convinces him to clean himself up and give a speech to the United Nations. The following day, Superman announced his former civilian identity to the world and delivers an ultimatum - all world governments must cease hostilities, or Superman will do it for them.    Chapter 7: Superman continues his worldwide crusade, stopping a US drone attack in the process. A military leader convinces the President that steps need to be taken to reign in Superman. A small squad led by the supervillain Mirror Master is sent to kidnap Superman's adoptive parents. Mirror Master burns their house down and traps the Kents inside a mirror. He orders Superman to stand down immediately or risk his parents being tortured and killed.    Chapter 8: Wonder Woman assembles the Justice League to inform them of the Kents' kidnapping and reaffirm her belief in the righteousness of Superman's quest. The League members team up to hunt down each of Flash's Rogues until Mirror Master is finally tracked down at World's End Bar in Keystone City. Mirror Master admits to hiding the Kents in the vast salt flats of Bolivia. As Superman rescues his parents, Batman confronts the President and admonishes him for targeting innocents and giving the Justice League a reason to rally around the fallen hero. The President questions whether Superman can be trusted any longer, knowing as he does about the corruptive influence of absolute power.      Chapter 9: Wonder Woman carries on Superman's crusade as she stops a war between Qurac and Justal. Greek god of war Ares confronts her about Superman's actions. Wonder Woman calls Superman "the greatest man I've ever known" and admits her desire to become his lover after his grieving process is done. She realizes Ares is frightened at the prospect of Superman and herself having children. Though Ares attacks her, Superman arrives to aid her and Wonder Woman brutally stabs Ares. She leaves the god of war to languish in the desert, hoping that an enforced peace will cause his powers to fade. Ares reflects that Wonder Woman may be Superman's final undoing, as she lacks his restraint in battle.

                                <p> Chapter 10: Superman enters the Batcave as Robin and Nightwing are sparring. He confronts Batman about his disappearance during the manhunt for the Kents and insists that he's only doing what Batman would do if he had the powers of a Kryptonian. Batman in turn chides Superman for resorting to murder, warning that once a horrible action is justified once, it becomes easier to justify again. Meanwhile, Aquaman and his Atlantean army attack a Japanese whaling fleet. The Justice League attempt to rescue the whaling crew and are drawn into a conflict with the Atlanteans.

    Chapter 11: The war between the Justice League and Atlantis rages on as Batman and Superman continue to argue in the Batcave. Superman argues that Batman loved having Joker as a nemesis, despite the casualties their rivalry caused. Batman lashes out and punches Superman, merely breaking his hand as a result. Batman then admits that Superman has always been the better man, but refuses to join him in his crusade. Aquaman calls forth an Atlantean superweapon, causing a tsunami wave to emerge and engulf the shipping fleet. The source of the tsunami is revealed to be a Kraken.


    Chapter 12: Superman emerges from the Batcave to join the fight against Aquaman. Batman radios Aquaman to warn him of Superman's unhinged mental state. While Aquaman initially agrees to back down, the Justice League realize he was only bluffing while his armies invaded several major cities worldwide. In retaliation, Superman raises Atlantis from the ocean floor and deposits it in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Aquaman finally relents, while heroes like Green Lantern and Shazam begin showing doubts about Superman's actions. Superman revokes Batman's access to the Justice League communicators, while Wonder Woman reassures him their actions were just. However, she pointedly neglects to pass along Aquaman's condolences about Lois' death.

    Chapter 13: The Justice League find themselves quelling an anti-superhero riot in Melbourne, Australia. A local hero named Galaxor attempts to drive the League away, but is brutally injured by Superman and Wonder Woman as Flash looks on. Distraught, Flash flees the scene and is directed by Batman to the laboratory where Galaxor lived and worked. Realizing the young hero had idolized the Justice League, Flash's faith in Superman is further fractured. He runs through the Australian wilderness, trying to ignore his growing inner turmoil.

    Chapter 14: This chapter opens with a flash-forward as Batman stands over a dead body that isn't fully shown, stating "My son is dead". The story flashes back shortly before, as Superman rescues two news anchors from being murdered by Two-Face on live TV. Superman publicly admits to killing Joker for the first time and pledges to protect the innocent, not psychopaths like Two-Face. Batman and Nightwing quickly fly to Arkham Asylum in hopes of stopping Superman from targeting the rest of Gotham's incarcerated criminals. But when they arrive, they discover that Damian has sided with Superman against them.

    Chapter 15: Damian Wayne begins this chapter by berating Batman and Nightwing for standing with the criminals. Then Wonder Woman tells Cyborg to begin opening the jail cells where the criminals are immediately teleported out to a "secure facility where they won't be able to hurt anybody anymore". Batman retaliates by setting off a virus in Cyborg's system, but Nightwing, the voice of reason, stops it. The scene moves to Green Arrow bringing Harley Quinn into Arkham Asylum. When he discovers the Justice League is in the Asylum, he rushes off to them and Harley breaks the guards nose to escape. When Green Arrow confronts the group, they hear in the speakers Harley Quinn release all the prisoners. The chapter ends with Solomon Grundy pulling Robin into the ground.

    Chapter 16: Harley Quinn watches Arkham's surveillance footage as the Justice League battle the escaped prisoners. Nightwing, Batman and Superman rush to rescue Robin from Solomon Grundy. Superman softens up the monster by cutting off his hand and flying through his chest, while Batman blows up his head. Though unharmed, Robin is embarrassed at being caught off guard and bickers with Nightwing. In a moment of anger, he throws an escrima stick at Nightwing's head, causing the hero to fall unconscious and break his neck. Both Harley and the Justice League are horrified. Batman carries Nightwing's body outside, once again lamenting that his "son" is dead and bringing the story full circle with the flash forward in Chapter 14.

    Chapter 17: In the aftermath of Nightwing's death, Catwoman is beginning a new crusade to steal from the wealthy of Gotham and give to the poor. She laments the lack of accountability for both the Justice League and the wealthy elite of the world. Catwoman is interrupted in mid-theft by Superman, but manages to briefly escape thanks to her Kryptonite earrings. However, when Superman catches her, he reveals that his goal is merely to persuade her to comfort Bruce over Dick's death. She reluctantly agrees, disgusted that the two men lack the courage to talk face-to-face. She arrives at Wayne Manor, comforting a distraught Alfed and convincing an enraged Bruce to give up being Batman for one night.

    Chapter 18: Batman and Catwoman arrive for a rooftop meeting with Commissioner Gordon, only to discover the President waiting for the instead. The President reviews the many unilateral actions Superman and the Justice League have taken in recent days. Both he and Batman agree that it's not Superman's place to forcibly end all worldwide wars and conflicts, and that the root causes of these conflicts remains. Batman agrees to put together a team to stop Superman's, but he and Catwoman implore the President to do a better job of trying to bring peace and equality to the world. After splitting up for a brief recruitment drive, Batman and Catwoman reconvene in the Batcave with their new allies - Green Arrow, Black Canary, Black Lightning, Aquaman, Batwoman, and Captain Atom.

                                <p>Chapter 19: Billy Batson is compiling a series of interviews about how ordinary Americans are responding to the Justice League's actions. When asked why he's performing the interviews, Billy's mind flashes back to a recent clash between the League and Black Adam. After a brutal fight, Wonder Woman uses her lasso to overpower Adam. The lasso compels him to reveal his magic word of transformation, but not before he pleads with Shazam to keep the kingdom of Kahndaq safe. Adam reverts to his elderly human form and is taken into League custody. Billy then decides to have a conversation with his magical alter ego. While Shazam thinks the League are working for the greater good, Billy is unconvinced. He feels his young age gives him a perspective many of his fellow heroes lack.

Chapter 20: A month after Joker's attack on Metropolis, an unknown source in the ruins of the city begins emitting a radio signal that constantly repeats "I'm alive." Cyborg is convinced the signal is trap. Regardless, Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern fly to Metropolis to investigate the signal. After entering a deep chamber and opening a massive steel door, Superman finds Lex Luthor inside. Unlike the regular DC Universe, these versions of Superman and Luthor appear to be close friends. Luthor learns of the League's recent actions and professes his desire to help. To prove he can be trusted, Luthor reveals that he has known the League's respective secret identities for years and never taken advantage of the knowledge. 

Chapter 21: Hawkgirl is intercepted and captured in the middle of a mission by Huntress and Black Lightning. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman travels to a refugee camp in Mogadishu. Realizing that removing one warlord won't stop the nightly cycle of abuse and rape, she kills the warlord and arms the women of the camp with the soldiers' weapons. Returning to the JLA Watchtower, Wonder Woman learns of Hawkgirl's disappearance. Luthor knows Batman is behind her kidnapping and is convinced that Superman needs more allies. But Batman reveals to Catwoman that he has replaced Hawkgirl with an impostor, who promptly arrives at the Watchtower to ease the JLA's fears.

Chapter 22: The impostor Hawkgirl claims Batman released her with a message of peace, hoping to convince the JLA to reconsider their actions. This leads to an argument where Flash and Shazam again question the League's recent actions. However, both Robin and Luthor agree that Batman is using Hawkgirl as a pawn to sow dissension in their ranks. Luthor feels the best course of action is for the League to address the world. Meanwhile, on Apokolips, Kalibak confronts his father Darkseid with news that Superman has seemingly abandoned violence for a life of peace. Darkseid permits Kalibak to lead an invasion party to Earth, before resuming his study and torture of the Black Racer (a New God embodiment of Death). Superman's speech to the world is interrupted by Kalibak's arrival. Numerous civilians die in the immediate outbreak of violence. Kalibak's boasts are quickly cut short as he sees rage overtaking Superman.

Chapter 23: Kalibak is taken aback by Superman's dark demeanor. Superman punches him into the sky, damaging a jetliner in the process. He continues savagely attacking his foe as more waves of Parademons appear in cities like Mumbai and Paris. Watching the chaos from the Batcave with his team, Batman knows that the Parademons are targeting the world's most populous cities in order to exact the highest death toll, and that Gotham is next. Black Canary implores him to seek the JLA's aid. Meanwhile, Kalibak retaliates against Superman. He believes Superman hasn't changed, and that he would still protect his enemies at the expense of innocent lives. Further enraged, Superman uses his heat vision to obliterate hundreds of Parademons.

Chapter 24: The Justice League continue to fight a losing battle against the Parademon armies. Kalibak tries to yield to Superman, but Superman is too enraged to consider allow a surrender. He continues beating Kalibak, telling him his "Daddy" isn't there to save him this time. After finally killing his foe, Superman confronts Flash and admits that Kalibak was right about Earth's heroes causing unnecessary suffering by allowing their enemies to live. When Flash admits that he can't think of a more effective solution than wholesale slaughter of the Parademons, Superman flies to space, gathers his strength, and begins destroying the armies at hyper-sonic speed. His actions prevent the imminent deaths of Green Arrow and Black Canary, but Batman is upset to see Superman resorting to even more bloody tactics. Amid the raining ashes of thousands of dead Parademons, Lex Luthor proudly displays Superman as the savior of the world.

Chapter 25: Neither Superman nor Batman are pleased with the outcome of the recent war. Superman realizes he and his handful of allies can't protect the entire planet. Lex Luthor suggests building a superhuman army to assist the Justice League. Meanwhile, Batman's team begins to fracture as Huntress and others voice newfound support for Superman. To help restore loyalty, Batman reveals his identity to the group. The group is then called on to stop a riot in Gotham from a Superman-worshiping cult. The rioters are contained just as Superman and Wonder Woman arrive. Superman and Batman stare angrily at one another, but Catwoman convinces Batman that the time is wrong for a confrontation.

Chapter 26: While locked away in the Fortress of Solitude with Martha and Jonathan Kent, Lex Luthor completes work on a drug that will turn ordinary humans into super-soldiers. The Kents implore him to understand that their son needs help to cope with his losses, and that Lex may one day be called upon to stop Superman if he falls too far out of line. Meanwhile, Superman engages Flash in a number of high-speed chess matches as they debate the idea of confiscating the world's gun supply. As Flash beats Superman with increasing speed, he points out that if their ultimate goal is to save lives, they might as well target smokers, reckless drivers, and even people who don't recycle. Superman studies his fallen king piece and mulls over the challenge of how best to use his powers to protect the world.

Chapter 27: Superman reveals his new super-soldier pill to the rest of the Justice League. Damian steals a sample and returns to the Batcave for the first time since Nightwing's death. Though Alfred is happy to see him, Batman is less enthused. Their conversation quickly escalates to physical violence, and the now super-powered Damian accidentally sends Alfred flying into the Bat Computer. Hawkgirl arrives and narrowly rescues Batman and Robin from being crushed by the giant penny. However, Damian realizes that Hawkgirl is actually Martian Manhunter in disguise. He throws down an incendiary grenade and makes his escape.

                                <p>Chapter 28: The Justice League react to the revelation that Batman had captured Hawkgirl and replaced her with an impostor. Realizing Batman will go to incredible lengths to control the battle, Superman decides to retaliate. He broadcast a worldwide message to announce Batman's betrayal and reveal his identity. Before Superman can actually out Bruce, Batman initiates "Protocol Icarus," shutting down the feed and sending the JLA Watchtower plummeting out of orbit. But thanks to Cyborg's abilities and Lex Luthor's smarts, Superman is able to post the information on various social media feeds. Batman and Alfred have no choice but to evacuate Wayne Manor and go into hiding. Alfred reiterates his loyalty to Bruce, as he writes his own name first on a checklist of important items to remove from the manor.

Chapter 29: In a flash-forward sequence, a bleeding Wonder Woman begs Superman to burn her with his heat vision. Five minutes previous, Superman leads a group of heavy-hitters to confront Batman at the Batcave. Batman shrugs off Superman's threats to stop interfering with the Justice league before soaring into the air. Realizing they're dealing with Martian Manhunter again, Superman and Wonder Woman pursue him into the sky. Martian Manhunter shows Superman visions of the death of Mars and the Green Martian civilization as a warning against what's coming. He then invades Wonder Woman's body, taunting the two heroes with the revelation that they always underestimated his powers. Superman finally relents and burns Martian Manhunter out of Wonder Woman's body. J'onn's body falls to Earth, apparently dead, as Batman looks on.

Chapter 30: This chapter takes place six years before the regular events of the comic and the destruction of Metropolis. A boy named James crashes his bike in a park and is rescued by Superman. After failing to fix the bike, Superman offers to fly James home. There he departs to deal with an attempted robbery, but Superman is able to shame the robbers into leaving rather than resorting to physical force. After a quick meeting with Lois, Superman returns to James' apartment with a replacement wheel, starting the boy's mother in the process. In the present, an older James laments Superman's fall from grace and the loss of both the City of Tomorrow and the "Man of Yesterday."

Chapter 31: The President is awoken in the middle of the night by Batman, who wants him to stage a massive distraction for the Justice League. Green Arrow and Black Canary enter Batman's newest hideout, which is hidden under a unisex restroom building. Batman reveals that Superman is manufacturing his super-soldier drug within the Fortress of Solitude and wants Catwoman, Black Canary, and Captain Atom to accompany him to break into the Fortress. The distraction he requested turns out to be a US naval blockade of North Korea. After a brief argument, Green Arrow joins the group. Catwoman is able to unlock the front door of the Fortress, but Batman is stunned to find the Kents standing inside. He knows that Superman react badly to any hint of an attack against his family. But Superman sees through Batman's facade and returns to the Fortress in a rage before Batman's team can retreat.

Chapter 32: As Superman stares on with Captain Atom's throat in his hand, his parents struggle to calm him down. Captain Atom breaks free and tells Superman he had the chance to "do the right thing." Their brawl brings the roof of the Fortress caving in, trapping Green Arrow. Outside, Captain Atom notes that the government always believed he had the power to defeat Superman, but that he never tried because he chose to serve his country rather than his own desires. Before he can unleash his nuclear energy against Superman, Wonder Woman arrives and pierces his armor with her sword. Captain Atom knows his death is near, and he decides to carry Superman into space so his self-destruction won't harm the rest of the planet. He explodes, injuring Wonder Woman and showering he planet in meteorites. Superman's fate is unknown.

Chapter 33: Superman recovers from the blast with only superficial wounds. He races back to the Fortress to discover Wonder Woman scarred and unconscious. Flash rushes to his aid, his faith in Batman now shaken by the attack. Superman enters the Fortress and finds Green Arrow with his parents. Knowing Superman will assume he means to kill the Kents, Green Arrow struggles in vain to put up a resistance. He ultimately decides to sacrifice himself, firing one last arrow out of the Fortress with a sample of Luthor's super-soldier pill for Batman to find. Ollie's last thoughts as Superman beats him to death are of Black Canary, his "pretty bird."
Chapter 34: Superman continues to pummel Green Arrow's corpse until his mother grabs his arm. He briefly calms down until realizing that one of the pills has fallen into Batman's hands. Meanwhile, Batman's team return to their base short two members. Batman implores the others to go into hiding while he analyzes the pill in the Batcave. Catwoman struggles to convince Batman to let her help him. Instead, he kisses her, knocks her out with sleeping gas, and departs. Back in the Fortress, the Kents and the holographic projection of Jor-El beg him to see reason and not kill Batman. He ignores their pleas and flies away. Ma Kent apologizes for failing to raise Clark properly, while Jor-El apologizes for unleashing him upon the world.

Chapter 35: Batman begins analyzing the pill as a mysterious figure appears on his computer screen, telling him to leave. Batman refuses, and moments later Superman arrives. Batman is left with no choice but to stall him until the computer is finished with its analysis. As Superman boasts that he removed every monster from Gotham except one, Bruce retorts by saying he won't give Clark what he's seeking - physical pain to drown out his emotional suffering. As the analysis nears completion, Superman admits that he doesn't want to kill his old friend, but merely ensure Batman won't be able to interfere with his plans for the world. Superman then breaks Batman's back just as Bane did years before.

Chapter 36: Having crippled Batman, Superman gloats that he's going to put his old friend away in Arkham with the rest of Gotham's monsters. But when Superman realizes that Batman was distracting him long enough to allow the computer's analysis to finish, he grows enraged and begins torturing Batman to find out where the information was sent. Batman's only reply is to tell Superman to remember this day - the day he resorted to torturing someone for the greater good. Superman is then confronted by Alfred. Having swallowed the super-soldier pill, Alfred begins savagely beating Superman, screaming "You don't get to hurt my family anymore!". Alfred carries his master to the teleporter, leaving Superman alone in the Batcave. Later, Superman appears before the United Nations with the rest of the Justice League. He informs the world that Batman is a dangerous terrorist, but that he and the League will fight to maintain peace and order.</p>
