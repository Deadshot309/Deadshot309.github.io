                                <h3>Chapter 1-9</h3>
                                <p>Chapter 1
Deep in the night, Batman overlooks the streets of Gotham from a rooftop, noting how quiet the city has become, calling it the Gotham he has always dreamed of. But the Dark Knight is quick to realize this dream has been perverted into a nightmare as he watches foot soldiers march in the streets below, carrying the insignia of the world's new iron-fisted ruler...the crest of the House of El, the symbol of the Man of Steel, Superman.

The comic jumps five years back, switching to Metropolis with Clark Kent suddenly awakening in bed as his super-hearing catches something and he looks at his sleeping wife, Lois Lane, and smiles as she awakens as well- Clark's hearing have picked up a second heartbeat within her. Clark is quick to begin making plans for their unborn child's future and well-being, ignoring Lois's calls to him, forcing her to throw a book at his head to get his attention. Though happy he's preparing for their child's future, Lois tells Clark to just enjoy the moment as they lean in for a kiss, only for Lois to get a sudden text message on a tip-off for a story of a corrupt senator taking bribes the Daily Planet is covering.

Lois decides to head out, shrugging off Clark's worries as she gets dressed and jokingly teases that he's only concerned about the baby. Clark suddenly gazes out into the city and Lois asks if there is trouble. Unsure, Clark replies maybe and Lois says they're both needed tonight. The two share a kiss and Lois tells him, "Go save the world."

The scene cuts to Batman fighting a group of thugs, with Superman watching and asking him why he's in Metropolis. Batman explains that something was stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs and he's on his way to investigate. Superman flies towards a rooftop, telling him to meet up with him when he's done with the thugs. Atop the roof, Superman prepares to tell Batman the news but the Dark Knight has already deduced it, surprising the Man of Steel.

Meanwhile, Lois meets up with Jimmy at the docks, with the younger man complaining of the cold and how the senator is late. Lois tells him to be patient when they spot someone approaching. Jimmy realizes it's not the senator as a gun barrel is thrust against the lens of his camera.

Back with the World's Finest, Superman asks Batman to be the godfather, successfully catching the stoic detective off-guard. Bruce smiles as he hears Clark speak of how he could hear his child's heartbeat while the two men gaze down on the illuminated city below.

Back at the docks, Jimmy is executed with a single gunshot before a horrified Lois...as she is greeted by the Joker and Harley Quinn.

Chapter 2
The next morning, Superman is horrified to discover Jimmy's body at the docks...next to a bloody Joker card.

Meanwhile, Batman is at S.T.A.R. Labs, looking over the damaged labs and questioning a scientist if anything else was stolen. The scientist explains only a small amount of equipment was taken and then points out why they didn't want to contact Superman. Batman points out they were experimenting with kryptonite.

The scientist tries to defend their actions, saying it was for beneficial reasons, not to hurt Superman, and that they are not monsters. As Batman looks down on the corpses of several lab workers, their faces twisted into horrible grins, Superman suddenly bursts in, panicked and telling Batman he can't find Lois. Batman tries to calmly remind him they're in public but when the Man of Steel holds up the Joker's bloody playing card, and pleads with his friend to help him.

The Dark Knight instantly understands and issues a priority call to all available Justice League members to head for Metropolis and help in the search for the Joker and to find Lois. While Green Arrow is incredulous, Cyborg is a little more helpful and Wonder Woman immediately heads for the docks where she was last seen. Batman next contacts the Flash, who is instantly in Metropolis and searches the entire city at super-speed at Batman's request.

A moment later, Barry comes back and takes Batman to see what he has found- the body of the Scarecrow in S.T.A.R. Labs, the deceased super-villain's face also twisted into a horrible grin, his murderer all too obvious.

Wonder Woman suddenly reports on a lead she found after using her Lasso of Truth on a witness who reveals the Joker has hijacked a submarine. A split-second later, Superman scans the waters around Metropolis and finds the sub, scuttling it onto land with his bare hands and tearing a hole in the hull to get inside. He is horrified to see the Joker and Harley seemingly operating on Lois, but before he can free her, the Joker gasses him, confusing the Man of Steel as he suddenly becomes dizzy...and then horrified to see the monster Doomsday standing before him.

Chapter 3
Confronted by the monster that killed him, Superman, fearing for his wife and unborn child's life, tackles the beast out of the sub and into the sky, while the Joker and Harley Quinn look on. The Joker decides to leave and has to convince a reluctant Harley to leave the stolen sub (Which she named Gunter) before the rest of the Justice League show up. They don't get very far before Green Lantern and Wonder Woman appear, with Lantern subduing them with a giant hand construct.

The Flash arrives with Batman in tow moments later, and while the Joker is delighted to poke fun at his nemesis for being carried by the Flash, the Dark Knight quickly investigates the sub, but not before placing a gas mask over his face when he notices Scarecrow's fear toxin laced within. Unable to locate Lois, he demands her location from the Clown Prince of Crime and stops Wonder Woman from using her Lasso on him, understanding that the Joker's warped mind would spill anything but the truth. The Joker refuses to give a straight answer, telling Batman he already knows what's going on, but simply refuses to accept it.

Still demanding answers, Batman learns that the Joker operated on Lois, turning her into a 'trigger'. Batman orders Flash to search the sub for its missile but the Joker tells him no to bother and that when Lois's heart stops, Metropolis stops with it. Confused, Batman suddenly puts it all together, realizing that the kryptonite stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs was laced into Scarecrow's fear toxin to infect Superman. Desperately attempting to contact the Man of Steel, who has flown 'Doomsday' all the way into the outer atmosphere when Superman suddenly clutches his head in a daze.

The Joker then mockingly asks Batman if he knew Lois was pregnant, prompting an enraged Dark Knight to punch him across the jaw. Batman then screams to Superman, "IT'S LOIS!" just as Clark sees his wife's body floating before him.

Horrified, Clark sheds a tear as he hears both heartbeats stop, while the Joker grins and says, "Boom." Just then, the nuclear bomb from the sub goes off in the heart of Metropolis, destroying the city in a single blast before the horrified eyes of the Justice League.

Chapter 4
As Superman cradles his wife's body and returns to the heart of his devastated city, on his knees with grief, Batman interrogates the Joker in a holding room in Gotham City's prison, demanding to know why he went so far as to trick Superman into killing his wife, unborn child and destroy his city. The Joker explains he was tired of losing to him and wanted to "Try it on easy" and declares that it was easy.

Back in the ruins of Metropolis, the Flash and Green Lantern have managed to remove some survivors from the city and the outlining area and Green Lantern questions Superman's location, with Flash revealing he is still in the city, his communicator no longer functioning because of the radiation. Flash explains no one else could survive that much radiation...

Within the ruins of his city, Wonder Woman approaches the grieving Superman, consoling him as he blames himself for Lois's death, reminding him the Joker is the one who is truly responsible. Considering her words, Clark asks Diana to hold Lois's body before flying off. He is intercepted by Green Lantern, who inadvertently reveals the Joker's location. Lantern, knowing how much pain Superman is in, tries to stop him using a shield construct but Superman easily smashes it to nothing and even manages to steal the ring off of Hal's finger, but catches him as he falls and destroys his communicator so he can't warn Batman. Despite Jordan's pleas for him not to do something he will regret, Superman flies off, declaring he already has.

Back at the Gotham Prison, the Joker reaches out to Batman, saying because someone took something away from him once, he became what he is today, and asks the Dark Knight what Superman will become after this, saying he was already a god who deluded himself into thinking he was a man. Batman is convinced that the Joker has failed to corrupt Superman, but the Clown Prince of Crime disagrees, saying it will be "A whole lot funnier than that."

Just then, Superman breaks through the wall, shoving Batman aside to get to the Joker. Without a word, Superman kills the Joker by shoving his arm through his chest, the Clown Prince of Crime dying with one last exhaled laugh and smile, while Batman looks on in horror.

Chapter 5
A mourning Harley Quinn murders the officers escorting her to Arkham after hearing about the Joker's murder and uses the officers car to head to one of her and the Joker's hideout, utterly despondent as she does, no longer caring now that the Joker is dead. Once at the hideout, she dons her costume just as Green Arrow arrives. She throws a grenade at him just as he fires an arrow, stunning him.

Harley advances and attacks Arrow with a large mallet, which turns out to be a squeak toy. Discarding the hammer, she pulls out a gun instead but Arrow manages to fire a bolt into the gun barrel, causing it to discharge harmlessly, amusing Harley greatly as she asks him to do it again. Arrow instead fires a net-arrow and successfully ensnares her.

After he's dragged her into his Arrowcar, Harley asks if he's taking her to Superman but Arrow denies this, explaining he's trying to save Superman from what he might do. Harley further annoys Arrow by asking more questions about his trick arrows and where he's taking her, before Arrow finally tricks her into knocking herself out with a gas-arrow.

When she wakes back up, Green Arrow has her hand-cuffed in his Arrow Cave, and while trying to explain she will be safe there, Harley just mocks the cave's name and suggests he call it 'the Quiver' instead. Arrow admits that's a better name. He tells her he has to leave and warns her not to try and use a fake hand to escape.

Harley sadly admits the Joker used the fake-hand gag while she used a fake mustache, saying no one has to justify a fake mustache. Harley then admits that while she knew the Joker was bad for her, she still hurts from losing him. Arrow is surprised that he understand what she means.

Harley then asks him to give her a little "maniacal laughter" which Arrow reluctantly gives into after seeing her put on her fake mustache, much to Harley's delight.

Chapter 6
Superman sits within his Fortress of Solitude, disheveled and still grieving for the loss of his family and city, all the while dozens of monitors surround him, with news programs all covering the same story: The destruction of Metropolis and the Man of Steel's murder of the Joker. Superman continues to listen when he hears a story over Biayla's bombing and communication blackout. Rising up, Superman declares, "No more" and flies out of his Fortress, his grief now replaced by determination.

In the Biayla city of Gared, Superman saves a boy from a munitions shell and destroys three more with his heat vision, saving dozens of grateful citizens. Superman apologizes to them for not being there before and flies off again, this time to Biayla's capital. Easily making his way inside and ignoring attacks from the president's men, Superman snatches Biayla's president and flies back to Gared, showing him the bodies of his people and declaring his presidency over for failing to protect them.

Wonder Woman suddenly appears behind Clark, landing next to him and pointing out the cameras, though the Man of Steel doesn't care and tells Diana he plans to address the world. Wonder Woman disagrees, saying the world will hear him but not there and after he's cleaned himself up. Superman agrees and leaves after Diana tells him she will call a press conference...and whispers to herself that he will finally say what she has waited for him to say since they first met.

Later, Superman arrives before the United Nations with the Biayla president, the press and Wonder Woman waiting. The Man of Steel apologies for his failings and reveals his secret identity as Clark Kent to the world. He then makes it clear that he will never let an event like Metropolis happen again and declares he will not allow anymore innocent blood to be shed or for world leader's to attack their own people, and that he does not care how politically powerful they are, he will stop them.

Declaring an immediate cease-fire for the entire world, Superman makes it clear they are to stop...or he will stop them himself.

Chapter 7
The U.S. Government is attempting to use an aerial drone to bomb a village a terrorist leader is hiding out in when Superman destroys the drone, unwilling to let innocent lives be harmed by the bomb. The general overseeing the bombing is angered by Superman's interference and pressures the U.S. President to allowing him to come up with a plan to force Superman to stop interfering.

The general explains they have a single card to play against Superman, and while the President is worried about this being traced back to them if they fail, the general assures him the plan won't fail and that nothing can be traced back to them. The President is still in disbelief over a plan to take out Superman. The general then explains they're not going after Superman...

A team of armed men break into the Kent's farmhouse and attempt to kidnap Clark Kent's parents, Jonathan and Martha, in their sleep. When the leader of the team grabs Martha, Jonathan attacks him but is subdued shortly. The mercenaries then set the house on fire, and the leader, revealed to be Mirror Master, teleports the mercenaries and the Kents into a mirror shard, moments before Superman arrives.

He calls for his parents but is greeted by Mirror Master from a mirror shard, with the rogue assuring him they're safe for now. Superman demands his parents return but Mirror Master refuses, and further angers the Man of Steel by mentioning his assault on his father. Mirror Master then tells Superman to stop interfering in the affairs of the world's governments and to go back fighting supervillains. If he does this his parents will live, but warns Superman if he forgets they will severely harmed...

Chapter 8
On the Justice League's Watchtower, Wonder Woman has rallied together several superheroes to inform them of the Kent's kidnapping. She gives a speech on the tragedy of Metropolis, Superman's current course of actions and how whoever kidnapped them wants the heroes to know their place, but Diana refuses to submit to their demands and asks for help in finding Superman's parents, stating she believes in his current course of actions.

Cyborg is the first to agree to help and soon all of the heroes decide to help. When Wonder Woman tells Flash Mirror Master was the one who kidnapped them. Flash says that if they find the other Rogues, they will find Mirror Master. Wonder Woman then orders Cyborg to set the teleporter for Central City. While Hawkgirl, Cyborg and Shazam battle and interrogate Weather Wizard, Captain Boomerang and Gorilla Grodd, Flash faces Captain Cold and learns that Mirror Master is at a villain exclusive bar in Keystone City called World's End.

Wonder Woman and the Flash head there, and Wonder Woman dissuades her enemy Cheetah from a fight after threatening her with the rest of the League's presence. Flash attempts to grab Mirror Master, but he is inside a long wall mirror and mocks the Flash for being slow. But McCulloch is suddenly attacked by Raven, who is inside his mirror dimension with him, and forces him out halfway. After wrapping his neck with her lasso and threatening to smash the mirror while he's halfway in it, Mirror Master quickly reveals the Kents location: Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Wonder Woman then strips Mirror Master of his weapons.

Flash meets with Superman at Salar, the world's largest natural mirror, and gives him Mirror Master's weapons to let him into the mirror dimension to rescue his parents.

At the White House, the President is informed of the plan's failure and he orders a new plan be formed against an even angrier Superman. The President steps into the Oval Office and is confronted by Batman, who chides the President for going after Superman's parents. The President is shocked Batman figured it out, though the Dark Knight coldly informs him he just told him.

The President asks if Batman will tell the League of his involvement and Batman says he won't but warns him if they ever find out on their own. The President is convinced they wouldn't touch him but Batman says no one would find his body on Saturn. Batman explains that the President's plan failed but succeeded in uniting the other heroes behind Superman.

The President notes Batman's use of terms and realizes Batman knows the path Superman is heading down. Batman says Superman is trying to bring about peace but the President asks how Superman will keep that peace. The President admits power corrupts as Batman leaves.

Chapter 9
An unknown figure observes Wonder Woman as she battles military forces, complimenting her skill, power and ferocity as she tears fighter jets apart. Wonder Woman soon contacts Superman to inform him of her success in forcing the forces to retreat back to their country of Qurac when she is attacked by tanks. Diana destroys one of them with a single headbutt, with the unknown figure stating that despite her desire for peace, she revels in war...and reveals Ares, God of War, himself before Diana.

Amused by her tactics against the tank, Ares explains in response to Wonder Woman's demands for an answer to his presence that he only wishes to watch her work. He goes to explain that while he has seen many wars, a war between superhumans and regular human armies is something special. Diana explains she is not at war with Qurac, only forcing their forces to stop attacking their defenseless neighboring country so that the issue can be resolved peacefully.

Ares asks her if she believes in Superman's cause, and Diana confirms this as she scares off more soldiers who attempt to attack. Ares calls her too merciful before asking Diana if she will "Take her place? Will you lie in his bed?" confronting her unspoken feelings for Superman. Wonder Woman admits that Lois was an incredible woman, and when Ares presses for an answer, Diana says she will let him grieve.

Wonder Woman calls Superman the greatest man she has ever known and then questions Ares over his fear of her and Superman's union. She asks Ares what he will become if Superman's endeavors succeed and mockingly suggests he become a god of something less violent. Enraged, Ares attacks Diana, proclaiming that Zeus himself would not save her so long as they are on a battlefield where Ares is strongest.

Before he can harm Wonder Woman, Superman appears and takes Ares down with a single blow, allowing Diana to cut off his hand. When Ares threatens her further, she impales him with her sword and leaves him to bleed. Superman, while disturbed by this, is assured by Wonder Woman that Ares will not die and the two head off to begin peace negotiations.

As they leave, Ares admits to himself he fears that Diana will strip away Superman's restraint, and nothing in the world would be able to stand against them if such an even occurred, and in a world without war, Ares is unsure what he would become...

                                <p>Chapter 10
Nightwing and Robin are sparring in the Batcave, with Nightwing having bested Robin and chiding him trying to go for a killing blow and failing to mind his legs. Nightwing briefly turns his back on Damian while telling him some criminals deserve second chances and they can't have them if Damian keeps going for lethal blows, allowing the younger man to throw one of his kali sticks at Nightwing's head- only for Superman to suddenly appear and catch it. Robin is shocked by the Man of Steel's sudden appearance while Nightwing is unfazed by Damian's sneak attack.

Superman asks if Batman is in and Nightwing tells him he's on his computer while Damian warns him he's being 'broodier' than usual. Superman starts to head further down into the cave when Damian suddenly thanks him for his execution of the Joker. Superman then asks Nightwing to take Robin and give him and Batman some privacy. Though confused, Dick agrees.

Superman confronts Batman at the Batcomputer, demanding to know why he wasn't there to help him find his parents. Batman only tells him he needs to stop what he is doing. Shocked, Superman proclaims he is saving lives and bringing dictators to justice, but Batman tells him he is scaring people. Superman suddenly lashes out, ripping off the Dark Knight's cowl with a scream of "GOOD!"

Superman rants about how they should be scared, too scared to hurt each other, and how he learned that from Batman. Bruce tries to say something but Superman goes on, saying he would be doing exactly what he is doing now if he had his abilities. Bruce reminds Clark that he killed a man, but Clark is quick to remind Bruce of all the times he let the Joker live, condemning more innocent lives. He asks him if he ever felt guilty or responsible.

Bruce admits he did, every time.

He tries to remind Clark that they don't get to decide who lives and who dies, but Superman justifies that one death saved millions of lives. Batman tells him that's how justification works, but soon the line of right and wrong will blur as he continues to justify his actions.

The scene shifts to a whaling operation off the coast of Japan, where an enraged Aquaman is consoling an injured whale. Infuriated, he tips the ship over to save the whales and a crewmen sends a distress call. Cyborg intercepts it and calls for all fliers to head there and help. Green Lantern, Shazam, Hawkgirl and Wonder Woman answer the call and soon learn it is not an attack from a country ignoring Superman's ceasefire.

Aquaman rises up from the seas with an Atlantean fleet and attacks the ship, denting the hull with a single punch and threatening a crewmen who fell overboard, begging for his life. Wonder Woman tries to appease to Arthur but he refuses to heed Superman's ceasefire, claiming it is his duty to protect the seas and all that inhabit them. Wonder Woman calmly tries to talk the situation out with Aquaman, but as she begins to approach him, she is shot in the face by one of his soldiers.

Aquaman angrily reprimands the soldier, but as he goes to check on Diana, she backhands him aside, infuriated and declaring she is sick of words, with her and the rest of the League advancing on Arthur's forces.

Chapter 11
Bleeding and unconscious, Aquaman is awakened by the whales he saved and promptly grabs Wonder Woman just as she is giving orders to the rest of the League as they face Aquaman's Atlantean fleet, dragging her under water to battle her.

Back at the Batcave, Superman accuses Batman of being angry at him for killing the Joker, thus taking away from him his arch-nemesis and that he is in the cave mourning the Joker, not Metropolis. Batman denies this, but Superman then asks why he didn't stop him sooner. His eyes burning red, he demands to know why Batman let the Joker do this to him.

Back at the Pacific Ocean, Wonder Woman grapples with Aquaman under water before Shazam intervenes and pulls Aquaman into the air. Holding him by his collar, he demands Aquaman to call off his forces and retreat, saying he is outmatched. Aquaman disagrees while behind the two, a sudden massive tidal wave rises in the distance.

In the Batcave, Superman tells Batman that he can't understand what the Joker took from him, the new life he and Lois were about to make with their child, and more so, Superman feels even more alone now as the true Last Son of Krypton. Superman then accuses Bruce of not consoling Dick and Damian for the friends they lost in Metropolis and then asks him what his excuse for not being a father is. Enraged, Batman punches Superman across the jaw, though fails to even faze the Man of Steel.

Shazam is unnerved when he sees Aquaman's army retreating, while Green Lantern and Hawkgirl see the tsunami but Hakwgirl notices there is something beyond it. When Shazam asks Aquaman what it is, Aquaman reminds him that he already knows what it is thanks to the Wisdom of Solomon. Shocked and in disbelief, Billy refuses to believe it at first until Aquaman reminds him of the company they keep and of Billy's own origins.

Back in the cave, Superman demands to see Batman's hand and uses his x-ray vision to see a hairline fracture on one of his fingers, advising him not to punch anything for a few weeks so it can heal. An alarm suddenly goes off, and Batman and Superman learn of the situation in the Pacific Ocean between Aquaman and the League. Superman starts to leave but Batman stops him.

Removing his cowl, Bruce tries to remind Clark that he's a better man than he is and that he can't use his abilities to put himself above everyone else. Superman asks Bruce to come with him, but the Dark Knight sadly refuses. Without another word, Superman turns his back to Batman and begins to leave the cave.

On his way he bumps into Alfred, who offers "Master Kent" some tea. Superman kindly refuses and reminds Alfred he does not have to call him master. Alfred dryly replies, "Good. Let's remember that."

Back at the Pacific Ocean, Wonder Woman has Green Lantern protect the ships from the tidal wave while Shazam lets Aquaman go. Hawkgirl spots what she thinks is mountains rising from the seas but Shazam corrects her as massive tentacles rise from the waters. Wonder Woman realizes they're now facing the kraken as the beast easily swats them all aside.

Chapter 12
As the Justice League fight a losing battle against the kraken, Batman accesses both the Justice League communications and the Atlanteans, warning Aquaman of Superman's imminent approach and tells him to stop his attack on the League. Superman arrives seconds later, flying through one of the kraken's tentacles to get to Arthur, grabbing him by his neck and demanding he call the beast off. Aquaman reluctantly does and the League rises out of the ocean with survivors.

Superman reminds Aquaman of his world-wide ceasefire but Aquaman reminds him that his voice does not reach the ocean's depths. Aquaman starts to speak of Superman ruling the surface world but the Man of Steel proclaims he doesn't want to rule, only protect. Aquaman knows of Metropolis's destruction but refuses to let Superman rule Atlantis. Despite Batman pleading with Aquaman not to provoke him, Arthur goes on about how Superman's rule is coming whether he knows it or not, but the seas will belong to him alone.

Just then, Wonder Woman rushes over to tell Superman that several Atlantean fleets are rising around several major ports around the world. When Superman demands answers from Aquaman, Arthur reminds Superman that the surface world lives around the seas and that he is not a world leader who can be bullied into submission. Declaring this a show of strength, Aquaman orders the League to leave.

Batman calls Arthur an idiot over their communicator, saying Superman will not respond to ultimatums. Superman suddenly flies off, much to Wonder Woman's confusion, thinking he is backing down. Superman says he is not, and orders her, Shazam and Green Lantern with him. When they ask where they're going, Superman responds that since Aquaman showed his strength, they will show theirs.

Combining their strength with Green Lantern's constructs, Superman, Wonder Woman and Shazam lift Atlantis from its resting place deep in the Mediterranean and place it in the Sahara Desert.

Batman contacts Superman as the Man of Steel observes the captured city but Superman refuses to listen to him, having been fully of aware of his contact with Arthur and has Cyborg revoke Batman's communicator access, officially kicking him out of the Justice League despite Batman's protests. After this Wonder Woman appears, saying Aquaman is ready to talk but Superman refuses to say anything else and has Diana go in his place as his diplomat.

Wonder Woman and Aquaman speak on the shore of Algeria, with Aquaman agreeing to pull his forces back. Aquaman expresses shock over Superman's actions, thinking he was not capable of it. He urges Diana to steer him from this course of action but she refuses, believing it is what's best for the world. Aquaman tells her they are frightening many people and asks her to pass along a message to Superman, saying he should seek his counsel when ready. He also asks Diana to tell Clark he is sorry about Lois.

Later, Wonder Woman returns to Superman to inform him of Aquaman's retreat. Superman is pleased, happy to inform Green Lantern and Shazam they can return the city where it belongs, and admits their removal of Atlantis didn't sit well with them. Wonder Woman assures him he did the right thing, though Superman is not as sure.

Superman then asks Diana if Arthur said anything else. After hesitating for a split-second, Wonder Woman says he did not.

Chapter 13
The Flash is seen running along the world's longest strip of land, the Nullarbor, in Australia. Calling it a speedster's nirvana, the Flash's internal monologue reveals he comes here often to run and think. But today he is only there to run.

Two hours earlier, the Flash accompanied Wonder Woman and Superman to a protest in Melbourne, Australia where they were trying to get the crowds to disperse peacefully when they were approached by a young man in a jacket. Saying they have the right to protest in their own country, the young man sheds his jacket to reveal a powered suit and demands that the League leave. The nameless young man blasts Superman and Wonder Woman, who easily dodge the attacks as they fly towards him.

As the Flash watches, he realizes how hopelessly outmatched the boy is and does nothing as Superman and Wonder Woman easily ground him, shattering his spine in the process. As the crowd looks at the beaten young man, Wonder Woman orders them to leave and they finally comply. Flash suddenly races off, telling Wonder Woman he is going to get an ambulance.

As he rushes off, Batman contacts Flash, surprising him as he thought his communication access revoked after being ousted from the League. Batman tells him he un-revoked it since he designed the communicators and informs him an ambulance is already on its way and directs Barry to the Advanced Science and Genetic Testing Laboratory in Canberra. Though confused, Barry complies.

Once there, Batman tells him he is on the wrong side and that he hasn't given up on him. Doctor Norris introduces herself to Flash and reveals the young man's identity, Mitchell Davis, Galaxor. The doctor then leads Barry to Mitchell's room, where he sees all the posters of the League and even a signed picture of Flash meeting Mitchell before he became Galaxor.

Horrified upon seeing the young man held the league in high regard, Flash doesn't respond when Batman asks him how Mitchell felt when his idols attacked and crippled him. Throwing his communicator aside, Barry flees.

Back on the Nullarbor, Barry comes across the body of a kangaroo, and realizes a truck driver probably struck it down without noticing. Seeing Galaxor in place of the animal, Barry asks himself what the League is doing. Unsure and uncaring, he races off, just wanting to run and not think.

Chapter 14
Batman looks down on a bloody body in horror, his mind flashing back to the night his parents were murdered, as the feelings of loss, regret and pain overwhelm him once again. He can only think, "He's gone. I'm abandoned again. My son is dead."

Hours earlier, Gotham's news channel is covering a special report by twin news anchors detailing how the nation is divided over their feelings on Superman's current course of actions. They turn to their guest but it becomes clear something is wrong. In the Batcave, Nightwing is watching the program and calls to Batman.

Back in the newsroom, Two-Face steps out of the shadows, revealing he was drawn by the subject of the program and brandishes a gun before flipping his coin to decide which of the two anchors he kills...only for a blast of heat vision to destroy it before it can fall back into Two-Face's hand. Outraged and confused, Harvey points his gun at Superman, pleading to know which side the coin landed on. Refusing to answer, Superman instead crushes his weapon and lets the security guards subdue him.

Superman then checks on the anchors and starts to leave when one of them requests to ask him some questions. Superman recognizes her and the anchor reveals they met at the Pulitzer awards, when he was nominated as Clark Kent but lost to his wife. The anchor apologizes but says she was the better writer. Smiling, Superman agrees.

The anchor asks if Lois would approve of his new proactive role he's taking, and Superman admits he can only hope she would, as he is doing this for her. The anchor then asks if he did kill the Joker and Superman admits he did. She tells him there isn't a single soul who thinks he did the wrong thing but Superman disagrees.

Looking at the camera, Superman addresses Gotham, telling the people there is something sick in their city. In the Batcave, Batman orders Nightwing and Robin to ready the Batplane, which confuses Robin, all the while Superman continues to explain that he is in Gotham to remove the dangerous inmates of Arkham Asylum so that they never harm any of the people again. Nightwing realizes this as they rush towards the plane...only for Damian to question why that's a bad thing.

Batman refuses to argue with his son and orders him to get on the plane but Damian refuses, saying he'll only go if they help Superman destroy the Asylum. Batman decides to leave with only Nightwing, much to Damian's ire.

As they fly off, Nightwing asks if Batman understands Damian's point of view, but Batman only says Dick was never as stubborn as Damian. Bruce asks him if he understands why they can't let Superman do this, and Dick says he does, but only because Bruce has had longer to indoctrinate him, but admits he does understand.

At the Asylum, a doctor is thanking Superman, Wonder Woman and Cyborg for returning a bound Two-Face but Wonder Woman tells him they've lost faith in the facility and are removing the patients. The doctor protests and Batman agrees with him, saying the League does not get to decide. Batman stands between the League and the more dangerous patients, with Nightwing standing by him, staff at the ready.

Wonder Woman is unsurprised to see the two and tells Robin he was right. Damian agrees, saying his father is standing with the monsters. He tells Superman and Wonder Woman they shouldn't be much trouble, all the while Batman watches in shock.

Chapter 15
Nightwing demands to know what Robin is doing, and the young teen defends himself, saying he is bringing criminals to justice and standing with Superman, Wonder Woman and Cyborg, while pointing out that Nightwing and Batman are standing with Killer Croc and a patient he does not recognize. Annoyed, the Calender Man proclaims his name and tries to remind Wonder Woman of an encounter they had on Easter but is disappointed when she doesn't respond. Superman understands that Batman won't stand aside but he makes it clear that he won't stop them from removing the Asylum's patients.

Batman tells him he shouldn't be in the Asylum with the more dangerous inmates and Victor Zsasz taunts the Man of Steel, asking him if he enjoyed the 'release' of murder. Wonder Woman then asks if Cyborg has control of the Asylum's security and when he confirms, she has him open Zsasz's cell despite Batman's protests. But before the killer can enjoy his freedom, he vanishes a split-second later.

Batman realizes the Flash is the culprit while a panicking Mad Hatter is taken next. The Riddler tries to say something but Cyborg orders him to be quiet while Batman demands to know from Superman where they are being taken. Superman reveals they are being taken to a more secure facility where they can't hurt anyone anymore.

Batman gives Cyborg a single warning not open another cell door but when Cyborg moves to open the Riddler's, Batman activates a virus he had implanted into Cyborg's systems, incapacitating him in a sudden burst of electricity. Wonder Woman and Robin plead with Batman to stop but he only watches, forcing Nightwing to deactivate the virus in an attempt to calm the situation down.

Outside the Asylum, Green Arrow brings a handcuffed Harley Quinn in, revealing she set fire to the Arrowcave. Arrow believes she'll be safe there from Superman but learns of the League and Batman's presence from an orderly. After Arrow races off, Harley sees Superman on one of the security monitors and quickly frees herself, knocking the guard out and taking control of the Asylum's security. She contacts a massive inmate underground and promises to free him if he'll destroy the Asylum for her.

As Cyborg recovers, he realizes Batman planted the virus in his system when they first met and moves to attack him when Green Arrow makes himself known by shooting an arrow between Batman and Cyborg. Batman asks if he's with the League and Arrow denies this, saying he's admitting someone. Harley's voice suddenly echoes from the speakers and she frees the inmates to let them have a fighting chance against Superman and the other heroes.

Suddenly, the room begins to shake and Solomon Grundy bursts from the floor. He snatches Robin and drags him underground, with Superman, Wonder Woman and Nightwing following after him while Batman is tackled by Killer Croc, only to watch helplessly as his son is dragged underground.

Chapter 16
Harley Quinn gleefully watches the Arkham Asylum inmates attack the Justice League, though she asks them to go easy on Green Arrow, accounting it as Stockholm Syndrome. Batman is being held down by Killer Croc and Calendar Man while the Riddler prepares to crush his head with a large rock. While the Riddler pauses to think of a riddle to say, Green Arrow hits the back of his head with a boxing glove arrow, allowing Batman to headbutt Croc and break free from his grasp.

Meanwhile underground in the Asylum's basement, Solomon Grundy holds Robin by his head in one giant hand while Wonder Woman attempts to free the boy by stabbing the zombie's arm with her sword, this only prompts Grundy to backhand her with enough force to send her flying through several walls. The Flash races after her, leaving Superman and Nightwing to deal with Grundy.

Nightwing informs Superman of Grundy's undead status and lets him know that he doesn't have to hold back against the monster since he will just regenerate. Flying ahead of Nightwing, Superman cuts off Grundy's hand with his heat vision, saving Robin and then charges straight through the monster's chest in a burst of gore. Nightwing frees Damian from Grundy's severed hand, asking him if he's okay. Robin angrily declares he had the situation under control, with Nightwing jokingly agreeing.

Just then Batman descends from the hole above, asking Robin if he's okay. Nightwing answers for him, and then the Dark Knight orders them to head back up and return the inmates to their cells. Robin protests that they're not going back to their cells but Batman just snaps at him not to argue. When Nightwing asks what Batman is going to do, the Dark Knight holds up explosives, preparing to bring Grundy down before he can destroy the Asylum.

Nightwing thinks Grundy has been dealt with but the monster rises back up despite its grievous wound. Batman orders them to go as he charges Grundy, planting the explosives on his head and then detonating them as he lands, decapitating the zombie and finally bringing him down. Superman compliments his work and Batman tells him they need to get Grundy back into his cell where the power dampeners can keep him under control.

Back up top, Robin angrily beats into several inmates, especially the Riddler, venting his disgust for all of them out. Nightwing tries to calm him down, but Damian calls him as bad as Batman, saying that Superman is right in that criminals don't deserve their protection. Nightwing tells him that Robin isn't supposed to beat people while they're down. Enraged, Damian screams that Nightwing is not Robin anymore and to stop telling him what do before throwing one of his kali sticks at Nightwing.

The stick strikes Nightwing upside his head, dazing him and causing him to fall down and break his neck on a piece of rubble. Damian approaches Dick's body, shocked and horrified when he doesn't respond. Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash and Batman rise up from the basement, the Man of Steel declaring the riot over.

Batman sees Damian crouched over Nightwing's body, the boy crying and apologizing. Shocked and horrified, Bruce shoves his own son away from Dick's body. Damian continues to say he didn't mean it, with Superman comforting him. Batman can only look down on his deceased protege's body, his mind flashing back to the night his parents died as the same feelings of horror regret and pain rise up. Several heroes look deeply saddened and even Harley Quinn begins crying.

With heroes and Arkham inmates solemnly watching, Batman carries Nightwing's body out of the Asylum and into the rainy night, thinking to himself that he is alone and "My son is dead."

Chapter 17
Catwoman comes across the body of a purse-snatcher named Joey Gutton, her inner monologue revealing how Joey fell on hard times and was forced to resort to stealing to support his family. Catwoman sees that Joey was shot and heads off, using her whip to get higher into the city's rooftops, her thoughts revealing that ever since Superman killed the Joker common criminals have become terrified of being killed by the Man of Steel, with more common criminals dying every night, with Catwoman blaming Superman, as he had murdered a man and was not punished, with more people following his influence after this and taking it upon themselves to kill more criminals.

Selina breaks into a high-res apartment building, calling the owner a true criminal due to the fact he chose to save himself and get richer when he let his company fall, but chose not help any of his employees. She is there to rob his safe and give most of the riches inside to Joey's family, while keeping the jewels for herself. She is just finishing when she realizes she is no longer alone.

Whirling around, Catwoman sees Superman himself. Before they can say much, the penthouse owner suddenly shows up. Forced to flee without her loot, Catwoman dives out of the penthouse and into the city below. Superman catches her and safely deposits her onto the streets below but becomes dizzy all of a sudden, allowing Catwoman to flee into the sewers.

Her inner monologue reveals she stole a small sliver of kryptonite from Batman's cave on one of her many nights at the mansion and fashioned it into an earring. She doesn't get far when Superman uses his heat vision to force her to remove the earring. Selina accuses him of wanting to kill her but Superman denies this, explaining that he just wants to talk.

Catwoman listens and is horrified when he reveals Nightwing's death to her. She tells him to talk Bruce instead but Superman says he can't, which upsets Selina, saying they're both too stubborn. Superman pleads with her to go to Bruce and Selina agrees, but asks Superman to punish not just the dictators who murder innocents through but the heads of the greedy corporations that have taken peoples homes and money from them, she asks him to punish them for they are truly evil.

Later that night, Selina goes to Wayne Manor and tries the door. When no one answers, she picks the lock and enters the Manor. She finds Alfred alone in the dark, having drunk himself into a stupor in grief over Dick's passing. When he tries to attend to Selina, she tells she will be looking after him for a while.

Selina makes her way down into the Batcave where Batman is furiously punching a training pole, his knuckles bleeding from the repeated impacts. She takes off his mask and urges him to grieve as she embraces him, giving him the support he needs.

Chapter 18
Batman and Catwoman are summoned to the Gotham Police Station by the Bat Signal, though Catwoman is reluctant to follow, unsure of the police's reaction to her with him. When they arrive at the station, they are not greeted by Gordon but the President and secret services. The President tells him he didn't know how else to contact him and that they need to talk in private.

Batman agrees but only if Catwoman accompanies him. The President leads the two to a secured room immune to Superman's sense. Along the way he offers his condolences to Batman for Nightwing's death but Catwoman tells him to change the subject. Once in the room, the President reveals Superman and Green Lantern are busy dealing with falling satellites over Russia, and the reveals that in the past week after removing the inmates from Arkham Asylum, Superman forced Israel and Palestine's leaders to negotiate peace terms or he would do it for them. While this happened, Wonder Woman repelled an invasion in Burma and Shazam and Green Lantern worked together to protect Syria from a missile barrage. Raven also terrified the warring tribes of Sudan into submission by summoning the image of her father, Trigon.

Catwoman doesn't understand how the Justice League preventing bloodshed is a bad thing, but both the President and Batman understand that while they can force temporary peaces, the reasons for the feuds remain and someone will have to enforce the peace. The President then correctly guesses that Batman knows why he came to him.

Batman knows that he thinks Superman will take over the world and the President wants him to stop him. The President asks Batman if he can do it. Batman thinks if Superman needs to be stopped, then he might be able to do it. Catwoman then reveals that she and Batman knew the President would contact them, with both telling him he needs to be a better leader so that the people will stop looking to Superman and condoning his actions.

Though the President is angered to think they are trying to enforce their will like Superman, Catwoman makes it clear when she says they're not telling him, but asking. Humbled, he promises he can only try.

Knowing they'll need a team to counter the League, the President hands Catwoman a folder containing files on potential candidates they can recruit who haven't joined Superman for their own reasons. Already possessing his own files on these heroes, Batman and Catwoman leave, both splitting up to begin recruiting.

In Starling City, Catwoman finds Black Canary battling some common thugs. After handling the thugs, Catwoman tells her that Batman wants to talk to her before asking about Harley Quinn being handcuffed in Green Arrow's cave. Annoyed, Black Canary tells her to drop it.

In Washington, Batman surprises Jefferson Pierce as he is working. Annoyed, Pierce asks him why he's there and Batman asks what he's working. Jefferson reveals he was commissioned by the Department of Housing to help find homes for survivors of Metropolis. Batman is grateful for his work and promises to help him but tells him he needs his help as Black Lightning.

The next day, Batman talks to a shadowed figure in the Batcave who informs him that 'they' are on their way. Thanking him, Batman tells him he is still unsure of who he can trust and asks the figure to keep his presence hidden. Understanding, the figure agrees.

Batman arrives before a large elevator and thanks his new allies for coming. Among them are Huntress, Black Canary, Green Arrow (Who makes it clear he hasn't agreed to anything but to talk), Black Lightning, Batwoman, Captain Atom and Aquaman.

As they sit down, Batman asks if they understand why he brought them here. Captain Atom responds and asks what they're plan of attack is against Superman and the League.
